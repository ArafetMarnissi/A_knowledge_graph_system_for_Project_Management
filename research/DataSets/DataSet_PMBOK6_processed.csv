1.1.3 CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT,14,"PMI publishes the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct [5] to instill conﬁdence in the project management  profession and to help an individual in making wise decisions, particularly when faced with difﬁcult situations where the  individual may be asked to compromise his or her integrity or values. The values that the global project management  community deﬁned as most important were responsibility, respect, fairness, and honesty. The Code of Ethics and  Professional Conduct afﬁrms these four values as its foundation. The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct includes both aspirational standards and mandatory standards. The  aspirational standards describe the conduct that practitioners, who are also PMI members, certiﬁcation holders, or  volunteers, strive to uphold. Although adherence to the aspirational standards is not easily measured, conduct in  accordance with these is an expectation for those who consider themselves to be professionals—it is not optional. The  mandatory standards establish ﬁrm requirements and, in some cases, limit or prohibit practitioner behavior. Practitioners  who are also PMI members, certiﬁcation holders, or volunteers and who do not conduct themselves in accordance with  these standards will be subject to disciplinary procedures before PMI’s Ethics Review Committee. 4    Part 1 - Guide","PMI publishes the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  to instill condence in the project management  profession and to help an individual in making wise decisions, particularly when faced with difcult situations where the  individual may be asked to compromise his or her integrity or values.

1.2.1 PROJECTS,32,"A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. u u Unique product, service, or result. Projects are undertaken to fulﬁll objectives by producing deliverables.   An objective is deﬁned as an outcome toward which work is to be directed, a strategic position to be attained,  a purpose to be achieved, a result to be obtained, a product to be produced, or a service to be performed.   A deliverable is deﬁned as any unique and veriﬁable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is  required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables may be tangible or intangible. Fulﬁllment of project objectives may produce one or more of the following deliverables: u n A unique product that can be either a component of another item, an enhancement or correction to an item,  or a new end item in itself (e.g., the correction of a defect in an end item); u n A unique service or a capability to perform a service (e.g., a business function that supports production   or distribution); u n A unique result, such as an outcome or document (e.g., a research project that develops knowledge that can  be used to determine whether a trend exists or a new process will beneﬁt society); and u n A unique combination of one or more products, services, or results (e.g., a software application, its associated  documentation, and help desk services).

1.2.2 THE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT,273,"Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the  project requirements. Project management is accomplished through the appropriate application and integration of the  project management processes identiﬁed for the project. Project management enables organizations to execute projects  effectively and efﬁciently. Effective project management helps individuals, groups, and public and private organizations to: u u Meet business objectives; u u Satisfy stakeholder expectations; u u Be more predictable; u u Increase chances of success; u u Deliver the right products at the right time; u u Resolve problems and issues; u u Respond to risks in a timely manner; u u Optimize the use of organizational resources; u u Identify, recover, or terminate failing projects; u u Manage constraints (e.g., scope, quality, schedule, costs, resources); u u Balance the inﬂuence of constraints on the project (e.g., increased scope may increase cost or schedule); and u u Manage change in a better manner. Poorly managed projects or the absence of project management may result in: u u Missed deadlines, u u Cost overruns, u u Poor quality, u u Rework, u u Uncontrolled expansion of the project, u u Loss of reputation for the organization, u u Unsatisﬁed stakeholders, and u u Failure in achieving the objectives for which the project was undertaken. Projects are a key way to create value and beneﬁts in organizations. In today’s business environment, organizational  leaders need to be able to manage with tighter budgets, shorter timelines, scarcity of resources, and rapidly changing  technology. The business environment is dynamic with an accelerating rate of change. To remain competitive in the  world economy, companies are embracing project management to consistently deliver business value.

"1.2.3 RELATIONSHIP OF PROJECT, PROGRAM, PORTFOLIO, AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT",336,"1.2.3.1 OVERVIEW Using project management processes, tools, and techniques puts in place a sound foundation for organizations to  achieve their goals and objectives. A project may be managed in three separate scenarios: as a stand-alone project  (outside of a portfolio or program), within a program, or within a portfolio. Project managers interact with portfolio and  program managers when a project is within a program or portfolio. For example, multiple projects may be needed to  accomplish a set of goals and objectives for an organization. In those situations, projects may be grouped together into  a program. A program is deﬁned as a group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in  a coordinated manner to obtain beneﬁts not available from managing them individually. Programs are not large projects.  A very large project may be referred to as a megaproject. As a guideline, megaprojects cost US$1billion or more, affect  1 million or more people, and run for years. Some organizations may employ the use of a project portfolio to effectively manage multiple programs and projects  that are underway at any given time. A portfolio is deﬁned as projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations  managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives. Figure 1-3 illustrates an example of how portfolios, programs,  projects, and operations are related in a speciﬁc situation. Program management and portfolio management differ from project management in their life cycles, activities,  objectives, focus, and beneﬁts. However, portfolios, programs, projects, and operations often engage with the same  stakeholders and may need to use the same resources (see Figure 1-3), which may result in a conﬂict in the organization.  This type of a situation increases the need for coordination within the organization through the use of portfolio, program,  and project management to achieve a workable balance in the organization. 12    Part 1 - Guide Figure 1-3 illustrates a sample portfolio structure indicating relationships between the programs, projects, shared  resources, and stakeholders. The portfolio components are grouped together in order to facilitate the effective governance  and management of the work that helps to achieve organizational strategies and priorities. Organizational and portfolio  planning impact the components by means of prioritization based on risk, funding, and other considerations. The  portfolio view allows organizations to see how the strategic goals are reﬂected in the portfolio. This portfolio view  also enables the implementation and coordination of appropriate portfolio, program, and project governance. This  coordinated governance allows authorized allocation of human, ﬁnancial, and physical resources based on expected  performance and beneﬁts. Figure 1-3. Portfolio, Programs, Projects, and Operations Looking at project, program, and portfolio management from an organizational perspective: u u Program and project management focus on doing programs and projects the “right” way; and u u Portfolio management focuses on doing the “right” programs and projects.

Description of PMBOK® Guide Key Components 19 1.2.4.1 PROJECT AND DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLES A project life cycle is the series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion. It provides  the basic framework for managing the project. This basic framework applies regardless of the speciﬁc project work  involved. The phases may be sequential, iterative, or overlapping. All projects can be mapped to the generic life cycle  shown in Figure 1-5. Project life cycles can be predictive or adaptive. Within a project life cycle, there are generally one or more phases  that are associated with the development of the product, service, or result. These are called a development life cycle.  Development life cycles can be predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, or a hybrid model: u u In a predictive life cycle, the project scope, time, and cost are determined in the early phases of the life cycle. Any  changes to the scope are carefully managed. Predictive life cycles may also be referred to as waterfall life cycles. u u In an iterative life cycle, the project scope is generally determined early in the project life cycle, but time  and cost estimates are routinely modiﬁed as the project team’s understanding of the product increases.  Iterations develop the product through a series of repeated cycles, while increments successively add to the  functionality of the product. u u In an incremental life cycle, the deliverable is produced through a series of iterations that successively add  functionality within a predetermined time frame. The deliverable contains the necessary and sufﬁcient capability  to be considered complete only after the ﬁnal iteration. u u Adaptive life cycles are agile, iterative, or incremental. The detailed scope is deﬁned and approved before the start  of an iteration. Adaptive life cycles are also referred to as agile or change-driven life cycles. See Appendix X3. u u A hybrid life cycle is a combination of a predictive and an adaptive life cycle. Those elements of the project that  are well known or have ﬁxed requirements follow a predictive development life cycle, and those elements that  are still evolving follow an adaptive development life cycle. It is up to the project management team to determine the best life cycle for each project. The project life cycle  needs to be ﬂexible enough to deal with the variety of factors included in the project. Life cycle ﬂexibility may be  accomplished by: u u Identifying the process or processes needed to be performed in each phase, u u Performing the process or processes identiﬁed in the appropriate phase, u u Adjusting the various attributes of a phase (e.g., name, duration, exit criteria, and entrance criteria). Project life cycles are independent of product life cycles, which may be produced by a project. A product life cycle  is the series of phases that represent the evolution of a product, from concept through delivery, growth, maturity, and  to retirement. 20    Part 1 - Guide 1.2.4.2 PROJECT PHASE A project phase is a collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the completion of one or more  deliverables. The phases in a life cycle can be described by a variety of attributes. Attributes may be measurable and  unique to a speciﬁc phase. Attributes may include but are not limited to: u u Name (e.g., Phase A, Phase B, Phase 1, Phase 2, proposal phase), u u Number (e.g., three phases in the project, ﬁve phases in the project), u u Duration (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, 1 quarter), u u Resource requirements (e.g., people, buildings, equipment), u u Entrance criteria for a project to move into that phase (e.g., speciﬁed approvals documented, speciﬁed documents  completed), and u u Exit criteria for a project to complete a phase (e.g., documented approvals, completed documents, completed  deliverables). Projects may be separated into distinct phases or subcomponents. These phases or subcomponents are generally  given names that indicate the type of work done in that phase. Examples of phase names include but are not limited to: u u Concept development, u u Feasibility study, u u Customer requirements, u u Solution development, u u Design, u u Prototype, u u Build, u u Test, u u Transition, u u Commissioning, u u Milestone review, and u u Lessons learned. 21 The project phases may be established based on various factors including, but not limited to: u u Management needs; u u Nature of the project; u u Unique characteristics of the organization, industry, or technology; u u Project elements including, but not limited to, technology, engineering, business, process, or legal; and u u Decision points (e.g., funding, project go/no-go, and milestone review). Using multiple phases may provide better insight to managing the project. It also provides an opportunity to assess  the project performance and take necessary corrective or preventive actions in subsequent phases. A key component  used with project phases is the phase review (see Section 1.2.4.3). 1.2.4.3 PHASE GATE A phase gate, is held at the end of a phase. The project’s performance and progress are compared to project and  business documents including but not limited to: u u Project business case (see Section 1.2.6.1), u u Project charter (see Section 4.1), u u Project management plan (see Section 4.2), and u u Beneﬁts management plan (see Section 1.2.6.2). A decision (e.g., go/no-go decision) is made as a result of this comparison to: u u Continue to the next phase, u u Continue to the next phase with modiﬁcation, u u End the project, u u Remain in the phase, or u u Repeat the phase or elements of it. Depending on the organization, industry, or type of work, phase gates may be referred to by other terms such as,  phase review, stage gate, kill point, and phase entrance or phase exit. Organizations may use these reviews to examine  other pertinent items which are beyond the scope of this guide, such as product-related documents or models. 22    Part 1 - Guide 1.2.4.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCESSES The project life cycle is managed by executing a series of project management activities known as project  management processes. Every project management process produces one or more outputs from one or more inputs by  using appropriate project management tools and techniques. The output can be a deliverable or an outcome. Outcomes  are an end result of a process. Project management processes apply globally across industries. Project management processes are logically linked by the outputs they produce. Processes may contain overlapping  activities that occur throughout the project. The output of one process generally results in either: u u An input to another process, or u u A deliverable of the project or project phase. Figure 1-6 shows an example of how inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs relate to each other within a process,  and with other processes.  Figure 1-6. Example Process: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs The number of process iterations and interactions between processes varies based on the needs of the project.  Processes generally fall into one of three categories: u u Processes used once or at predefined points in the project. The processes Develop Project Charter and Close  Project or Phase are examples. u u Processes that are performed periodically as needed. The process Acquire Resources is performed as  resources are needed. The process Conduct Procurements is performed prior to needing the procured item. u u Processes that are performed continuously throughout the project. The process Deﬁne Activities may  occur throughout the project life cycle, especially if the project uses rolling wave planning or an adaptive  development approach. Many of the monitoring and control processes are ongoing from the start of the  project, until it is closed out. Project management is accomplished through the appropriate application and integration of logically grouped project  management processes.

1.2.5 TAILORING,1145,"Usually, project managers apply a project management methodology to their work. A methodology is a system of  practices, techniques, procedures, and rules used by those who work in a discipline. This deﬁnition makes it clear that  this guide itself is not a methodology. This guide and The Standard for Project Management [1] are recommended references for tailoring, because these  standard documents identify the subset of the project management body of knowledge that is generally recognized as  good practice. “Good practice” does not mean that the knowledge described should always be applied uniformly to all  projects. Speciﬁc methodology recommendations are outside the scope of this guide. Project management methodologies may be: u u Developed by experts within the organization, u u Purchased from vendors, u u Obtained from professional associations, or u u Acquired from government agencies. The appropriate project management processes, inputs, tools, techniques, outputs, and life cycle phases should be  selected to manage a project. This selection activity is known as tailoring project management to the project. The project  manager collaborates with the project team, sponsor, organizational management, or some combination thereof, in the  tailoring. In some cases, the organization may require speciﬁc project management methodologies be used. Tailoring is necessary because each project is unique; not every process, tool, technique, input, or output identiﬁed  in the PMBOK® Guide is required on every project. Tailoring should address the competing constraints of scope,  schedule, cost, resources, quality, and risk. The importance of each constraint is different for each project, and the  project manager tailors the approach for managing these constraints based on the project environment, organizational  culture, stakeholder needs, and other variables. In tailoring project management, the project manager should also consider the varying levels of governance that may  be required and within which the project will operate, as well as considering the culture of the organization. In addition,  consideration of whether the customer of the project is internal or external to the organization may affect project  management tailoring decisions. Sound project management methodologies take into account the unique nature of projects and allow tailoring,  to some extent, by the project manager. However, the tailoring that is included in the methodology may still require  additional tailoring for a given project. ","Usually, project managers apply a project management methodology to their work. A methodology is a system of  practices, techniques, procedures, and rules used by those who work in a discipline. This denition makes it clear that  this guide itself is not a methodology. This guide and The Standard for Project Management  are recommended references for tailoring, because these  standard documents identify the subset of the project management body of knowledge that is generally recognized as  good practice. Good practice does not mean that the knowledge described should always be applied uniformly to all  projects. Specic methodology recommendations are outside the scope of this guide. Project management methodologies may be: u u Developed by experts within the organization, u u Purchased from vendors, u u Obtained from professional associations, or u u Acquired from government agencies. The appropriate project management processes, inputs, tools, techniques, outputs, and life cycle phases should be  selected to manage a project. This selection activity is known as tailoring project management to the project.

1.2.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS DOCUMENTS,1179,"The project manager needs to ensure that the project management approach captures the intent of business  documents. These documents are deﬁned in Table 1-5. These two documents are interdependent and iteratively  developed and maintained throughout the life cycle of the project. Table 1-5. Project Business Documents The project sponsor is generally accountable for the development and maintenance of the project business case  document. The project manager is responsible for providing recommendations and oversight to keep the project  business case, project management plan, project charter, and project beneﬁts management plan success measures in  alignment with one another and with the goals and objectives of the organization. Project managers should appropriately tailor the noted project management documents for their projects. In some  organizations, the business case and beneﬁts management plan are maintained at the program level. Project managers  should work with the appropriate program managers to ensure the project management documents are aligned with  the program documents. Figure 1-8 illustrates the interrelationship of these critical project management business  documents and the needs assessment. Figure 1-8 shows an approximation of the life cycle of these various documents  against the project life cycle.

The business case lists the objectives and reasons for project initiation. It helps measure the  project success at the end of the project against the project objectives. The business case is a project business document  that is used throughout the project life cycle. The business case may be used before the project initiation and may result  in a go/no-go decision for the project. A needs assessment often precedes the business case. The needs assessment involves understanding business  goals and objectives, issues, and opportunities and recommending proposals to address them. The results of the needs  assessment may be summarized in the business case document.

The minimum may be established  by identifying the set of documented criteria that are key in addressing the problem or opportunity. u m Do more than the minimum work possible to address the problem or opportunity. This option meets the  minimum set of criteria and some or all of the other documented criteria. There may be more than one of  these options documented in the business case. 32    Part 1 - Guide u u Recommendation: u n A statement of the recommended option to pursue in the project; u n Items to include in the statement may include but are not limited to: u m Analysis results for the potential option; u m Constraints, assumptions, risks, and dependencies for the potential options;  and u m Success measures (see Section 1.2.6.4). u n An implementation approach that may include but is not limited to: u m Milestones, u m Dependencies, and u m Roles and responsibilities. u u Evaluation: u n Statement describing the plan for measuring beneﬁts the project will deliver.

2.1 OVERVIEW,1438,"Projects exist and operate in environments that may have an inﬂuence on them. These inﬂuences can have a favorable  or unfavorable impact on the project. Two major categories of inﬂuences are enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) and  organizational process assets (OPAs). EEFs originate from the environment outside of the project and often outside of the enterprise. EEFs may have an  impact at the organizational, portfolio, program, or project level. See Section 2.2 for additional information on EEFs. OPAs are internal to the organization. These may arise from the organization itself, a portfolio, a program, another  project, or a combination of these. Figure 2-1 shows the breakdown of project inﬂuences into EEFs and OPAs. See  Section 2.3 for additional information on OPAs. Figure 2-1. Project Influences In addition to EEFs and OPAs, organizational systems play a signiﬁcant role in the life cycle of the project.

2.4.1 OVERVIEW,1620,"Projects operate within the constraints imposed by the organization through their structure and governance framework.  To operate effectively and efﬁciently, the project manager needs to understand where responsibility, accountability, and  authority reside within the organization. This understanding will help the project manager effectively use his or her  power, inﬂuence, competence, leadership, and political capabilities to successfully complete the project. The interaction of multiple factors within an individual organization creates a unique system that impacts the project  operating in that system. The resulting organizational system determines the power, inﬂuence, interests, competence,  and political capabilities of the people who are able to act within the system. The system factors include but are not  limited to: u u Management elements, u u Governance frameworks, and u u Organizational structure types. The complete information and explanation of the organizational system factors and how the combination of  these factors impacts a project are beyond the scope of this guide. There are disciplines with associated literature,  methodologies, and practices that address these factors in more depth than is possible within this guide. This section  provides an overview of these factors and their interrelationship. This overview begins by discussing systems in general. A system is a collection of various components that together  can produce results not obtainable by the individual components alone. A component is an identiﬁable element within  the project or organization that provides a particular function or group of related functions. The interaction of the various  system components creates the organizational culture and capabilities. There are several principles regarding systems: u u Systems are dynamic, u u Systems can be optimized, u u System components can be optimized, u u Systems and their components cannot be optimized at the same time, and u u Systems are nonlinear in responsiveness (a change in the input does not produce a predictable change in  the output). 43 Multiple changes may occur within the system and between the system and its environment. When these changes  take place, adaptive behavior occurs within the components that in turn add to the system’s dynamics. The system’s  dynamics are deﬁned by the interaction between the components based on the relationships and dependencies that  exist between the components. Systems are typically the responsibility of an organization’s management. The organization’s management examines  the optimization trade-offs between the components and the system in order to take the appropriate action to achieve  the best outcomes for the organization. The results of this examination will impact the project under consideration.  Therefore, it is important that the project manager take these results into account when determining how to fulﬁll the  project’s objectives. In addition, the project manager should take into account the organization’s governance framework.","Projects operate within the constraints imposed by the organization through their structure and governance framework.

2.4.2 ORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS,1664,"Recent PMI research reveals that governance refers to organizational or structural arrangements at all levels of  an organization designed to determine and inﬂuence the behavior of the organization’s members [9]. This research  suggests that the concept of governance is multidimensional and: u u Includes consideration of people, roles, structures, and policies; and u u Requires providing direction and oversight through data and feedback. 2.4.2.1 GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK Governance is the framework within which authority is exercised in organizations. This framework includes but is not  limited to: u u Rules, u u Policies, u u Procedures, u u Norms, u u Relationships, u u Systems, and u u Processes. This framework inﬂuences how: u u Objectives of the organization are set and achieved, u u Risk is monitored and assessed, and u u Performance is optimized. 44    Part 1 - Guide 2.4.2.2 GOVERNANCE OF PORTFOLIOS, PROGRAMS, AND PROJECTS The Governance of Portfolios, Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide [10] describes a common governance  framework aligning organizational project management (OPM) and portfolio, program, and project management.  The practice guide describes four governance domains of alignment, risk, performance, and communications.  Each domain has the following functions: oversight, control, integration, and decision making. Each function has  governance supporting processes and activities for stand-alone projects, or projects operating within the portfolio or  program environments.  Project governance refers to the framework, functions, and processes that guide project management activities in  order to create a unique product, service, or result to meet organizational, strategic, and operational goals. There is  no one governance framework that is effective in all organizations. A governance framework should be tailored to the  organizational culture, types of projects, and the needs of the organization in order to be effective. For more information regarding project governance, including its implementation, see Governance of Portfolios,  Programs, and Projects: A Practice Guide [10].","Recent PMI research reveals that governance refers to organizational or structural arrangements at all levels of  an organization designed to determine and inuence the behavior of the organizations members . This research  suggests that the concept of governance is multidimensional and: u u Includes consideration of people, roles, structures, and policies; and u u Requires providing direction and oversight through data and feedback. 2.4.2.1 GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK Governance is the framework within which authority is exercised in organizations. This framework includes but is not  limited to: u u Rules, u u Policies, u u Procedures, u u Norms, u u Relationships, u u Systems, and u u Processes.

2.4.3 MANAGEMENT ELEMENTS,1711,"Management elements are the components that comprise the key functions or principles of general management in  the organization. The general management elements are allocated within the organization according to its governance  framework and the organizational structure type selected. The key functions or principles of management include but are not limited to: u u Division of work using specialized skills and availability to perform work; u u Authority given to perform work; u u Responsibility to perform work appropriately assigned based on such attributes as skill and experience; u u Discipline of action (e.g., respect for authority, people, and rules); u u Unity of command (e.g., only one person gives orders for any action or activity to an individual); u u Unity of direction (e.g., one plan and one head for a group of activities with the same objective); u u General goals of the organization take precedence over individual goals; u u Paid fairly for work performed; 45 u u Optimal use of resources; u u Clear communication channels; u u Right materials to the right person for the right job at the right time; u u Fair and equal treatment of people in the workplace; u u Clear security of work positions; u u Safety of people in the workplace; u u Open contribution to planning and execution by each person; and u u Optimal morale. Performance of these management elements are assigned to selected individuals within the organization. These  individuals may perform the noted functions within various organizational structures. For example, in a hierarchical  structure, there are horizontal and vertical levels within the organization. These hierarchical levels range from the line  management level through to the executive management level. The responsibility, accountability, and authority assigned  to the hierarchical level indicate how the individual may perform the noted function within that organizational structure.","Management elements are the components that comprise the key functions or principles of general management in  the organization.

3.1 OVERVIEW,2008,"The project manager plays a critical role in the leadership of a project team in order to achieve the project’s  objectives. This role is clearly visible throughout the project. Many project managers become involved in a project from  its initiation through closing. However, in some organizations, a project manager may be involved in evaluation and  analysis activities prior to project initiation. These activities may include consulting with executive and business unit  leaders on ideas for advancing strategic objectives, improving organizational performance, or meeting customer needs.  In some organizational settings, the project manager may also be called upon to manage or assist in business analysis,  business case development, and aspects of portfolio management for a project. A project manager may also be involved  in follow-on activities related to realizing business beneﬁts from the project. The role of a project manager may vary  from organization to organization. Ultimately, the project management role is tailored to ﬁt the organization in the same  way that the project management processes are tailored to ﬁt the project. A simple analogy may help in understanding the roles of a project manager for a large project by comparing them to  the roles of a conductor for a large orchestra: u u Membership and roles. A large project and an orchestra each comprise many members, each playing a  different role. A large orchestra may have more than 100 musicians who are led by a conductor. These musicians  may play 25 different kinds of instruments placed into major sections, such as strings, woodwinds, brass, and  percussion. Similarly, a large project may have more than 100 project members led by a project manager. Team  members may fulﬁll many different roles, such as design, manufacturing, and facilities management. Like the  major sections of the orchestra, they represent multiple business units or groups within an organization. The  musicians and the project members make up each leader’s team. u u Responsibility for team. The project manager and conductor are both responsible for what their teams  produce—the project outcome or the orchestra concert, respectively. The two leaders need to take a holistic  view of their team’s products in order to plan, coordinate, and complete them. The two leaders begin by reviewing  the vision, mission, and objectives of their respective organizations to ensure alignment with their products.  The two leaders establish their interpretation of the vision, mission, and objectives involved in successfully  completing their products. The leaders use their interpretation to communicate and motivate their teams toward  the successful completion of their objectives.   52    Part 1 - Guide u u Knowledge and skills: u n The conductor is not expected to be able to play every instrument in the orchestra, but should possess  musical knowledge, understanding, and experience.

The conductor provides written communication in the  form of musical scores and practice schedules. The conductor also communicates in real time with the team  by using a baton and other body movements. u n The project manager is not expected to perform every role on the project, but should possess project  management knowledge, technical knowledge, understanding, and experience. The project manager provides  the project team with leadership, planning, and coordination through communications.

3.2 DEFINITION OF A PROJECT MANAGER,2058,"The role of a project manager is distinct from that of a functional manager or operations manager. Typically, the  functional manager focuses on providing management oversight for a functional or business unit. Operations managers  are responsible for ensuring that business operations are efﬁcient. The project manager is the person assigned by the  performing organization to lead the team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives.","The role of a project manager is distinct from that of a functional manager or operations manager.

3.3.1 OVERVIEW,2064,Project managers fulﬁll numerous roles within their sphere of inﬂuence. These roles reﬂect the project manager’s  capabilities and are representative of the value and contributions of the project management profession. This section  highlights the roles of the project manager in the various spheres of inﬂuence shown in Figure 3-1. ,Project managers fulll numerous roles within their sphere of inuence. These roles reect the project managers  capabilities and are representative of the value and contributions of the project management profession. 
3.3.2 THE PROJECT,2083,"The project manager leads the project team to meet the project’s objectives and stakeholders’ expectations. The  project manager works to balance the competing constraints on the project with the resources available. The project manager also performs communication roles between the project sponsor, team members, and other  stakeholders. This includes providing direction and presenting the vision of success for the project. The project manager  uses soft skills (e.g., interpersonal skills and the ability to manage people) to balance the conﬂicting and competing  goals of the project stakeholders in order to achieve consensus. In this context, consensus means that the relevant  stakeholders support the project decisions and actions even when there is not 100% agreement. Research shows that successful project managers consistently and effectively use certain essential skills. Research  reveals that the top 2% of project managers as designated by their bosses and team members distinguish themselves  by demonstrating superior relationship and communication skills while displaying a positive attitude [12].   54    Part 1 - Guide The ability to communicate with stakeholders, including the team and sponsors applies across multiple aspects of  the project including, but not limited to, the following: u u Developing ﬁnely tuned skills using multiple methods (e.g., verbal, written, and nonverbal); u u Creating, maintaining, and adhering to communications plans and schedules; u u Communicating predictably and consistently; u u Seeking to understand the project stakeholders’ communication needs (communication may be the only  deliverable that some stakeholders received until the project’s end product or service is completed); u u Making communications concise, clear, complete, simple, relevant, and tailored; u u Including important positive and negative news; u u Incorporating feedback channels; and u u Relationship skills involving the development of extensive networks of people throughout the project manager’s  spheres of inﬂuence. These networks include formal networks such as organizational reporting structures.  However, the informal networks that project managers develop, maintain, and nurture are more important.  Informal networks include the use of established relationships with individuals such as subject matter experts  and inﬂuential leaders. Use of these formal and informal networks allows the project manager to engage multiple  people in solving problems and navigating the bureaucracies encountered in a project.","The project manager leads the project team to meet the projects objectives and stakeholders expectations.

3.3.3 THE ORGANIZATION,2121,"The project manager proactively interacts with other project managers. Other independent projects or projects that  are part of the same program may impact a project due to but not limited to the following: u u Demands on the same resources, u u Priorities of funding, u u Receipt or distribution of deliverables, and u u Alignment of project goals and objectives with those of the organization. Interacting with other project managers helps to create a positive inﬂuence for fulﬁlling the various needs of the  project. These needs may be in the form of human, technical, or ﬁnancial resources and deliverables required by the  team for project completion. The project manager seeks ways to develop relationships that assist the team in achieving  the goals and objectives of the project. 55 In addition, the project manager maintains a strong advocacy role within the organization. The project manager  proactively interacts with managers within the organization during the course of the project. The project manager also  works with the project sponsor to address internal political and strategic issues that may impact the team or the viability  or quality of the project. The project manager may work toward increasing the project management competency and capability within the  organization as a whole and is involved in both tacit and explicit knowledge transfer or integration initiatives (see  Section 4.4 on Manage Project Knowledge). The project manager also works to: u u Demonstrate the value of project management, u u Increase acceptance of project management in the organization, and u u Advance the efﬁcacy of the PMO when one exists in the organization. Depending on the organizational structure, a project manager may report to a functional manager. In other cases,  a project manager may be one of several project managers who report to a PMO or a portfolio or program manager  who is ultimately responsible for one or more organization-wide projects. The project manager works closely with all  relevant managers to achieve the project objectives and to ensure the project management plan aligns with the portfolio  or program plan. The project manager also works closely and in collaboration with other roles, such as organizational  managers, subject matter experts, and those involved with business analysis. In some situations, the project manager  may be an external consultant placed in a temporary management role.","The project manager proactively interacts with other project managers.

3.4.4 LEADERSHIP SKILLS,2324,"Leadership skills involve the ability to guide, motivate, and direct a team. These skills may include demonstrating  essential capabilities such as negotiation, resilience, communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and interpersonal  skills. Projects are becoming increasingly more complicated with more and more businesses executing their strategy  through projects. Project management is more than just working with numbers, templates, charts, graphs, and computing  systems. A common denominator in all projects is people. People can be counted, but they are not numbers. 3.4.4.1 DEALING WITH PEOPLE A large part of the project manager’s role involves dealing with people. The project manager should study people’s  behaviors and motivations. The project manager should strive to be a good leader, because leadership is crucial to the  success of projects in organizations.

3.4.5 COMPARISON OF LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT,2463,"The words leadership and management are often used interchangeably. However, they are not synonymous. The  word management is more closely associated with directing another person to get from one point to another using a  known set of expected behaviors. In contrast, leadership involves working with others through discussion or debate in  order to guide them from one point to another. The method that a project manager chooses to employ reveals a distinct difference in behavior, self-perception, and  project role. Table 3-1 compares management and leadership on several important levels. Project managers need to employ both leadership and management in order to be successful. The skill is in ﬁnding  the right balance for each situation. The way in which management and leadership are employed often shows up in the  project manager’s leadership style. Table 3-1.

3.5 PERFORMING INTEGRATION,2560,"The role of the project manager is twofold when performing integration on the project: u u Project managers play a key role in working with the project sponsor to understand the strategic objectives and  ensure the alignment of the project objectives and results with those of the portfolio, program, and business  areas. In this way, project managers contribute to the integration and execution of the strategy. u u Project managers are responsible for guiding the team to work together to focus on what is really essential at the  project level. This is achieved through the integration of processes, knowledge, and people. Integration is a critical skill for project managers.

3.5.1 PERFORMING INTEGRATION AT THE PROCESS LEVEL,2574,"Project management may be seen as a set of processes and activities that are undertaken to achieve the project  objectives. Some of these processes may take place once (e.g., the initial creation of the project charter), but many others  overlap and occur several times throughout the project. One example of this process overlap and multiple occurrences  is a change in a requirement that impacts scope, schedule, or budget and requires a change request. Several project  management processes such as the Control Scope process and the Perform Integrated Change Control process may  involve a change request. The Perform Integrated Change Control process occurs throughout the project for integrating  change requests. Although there is no stated deﬁnition on how to integrate the project processes, it is clear that a project has a small  chance of meeting its objective when the project manager fails to integrate the project processes where they interact.","Project management may be seen as a set of processes and activities that are undertaken to achieve the project  objectives.

3.5.4 INTEGRATION AND COMPLEXITY,2604,"Some projects may be referred to as complex and considered difﬁcult to manage. In simple terms, complex and  complicated are concepts often used to describe what is considered to be intricate or complicated. Complexity within projects is a result of the organization’s system behavior, human behavior, and the uncertainty at  work in the organization or its environment. In Navigating Complexity: A Practice Guide [13], these three dimensions of  complexity are deﬁned as: u u System behavior. The interdependencies of components and systems. u u Human behavior. The interplay between diverse individuals and groups. u u Ambiguity. Uncertainty of emerging issues and lack of understanding or confusion. Complexity itself is a perception of an individual based on personal experience, observation, and skill. Rather than  being complex, a project is more accurately described as containing complexity. Portfolios, programs, and projects may  contain elements of complexity. When approaching the integration of a project, the project manager should consider elements that are both inside and  outside of the project. The project manager should examine the characteristics or properties of the project. Complexity  as a characteristic or property of a project is typically deﬁned as: u u Containing multiple parts, u u Possessing a number of connections between the parts, u u Exhibiting dynamic interactions between the parts, and u u Exhibiting behavior produced as a result of those interactions that cannot be explained as the simple sum of the  parts (e.g., emergent behavior). Examining these various items that appear to make the project complex should help the project manager identify key  areas when planning, managing, and controlling the project to ensure integration.

Although the business documents are developed prior to the project, they are reviewed periodically. u u Business case. The approved business case, or similar, is the business document most commonly used to  create the project charter. The business case describes the necessary information from a business standpoint to  determine whether the expected outcomes of the project justify the required investment. It is commonly used for  decision making by managers or executives above the project level. Typically, the business need and the cost- beneﬁt analysis are contained in the business case to justify and establish boundaries for the project. For more  information on the business case, see Section 1.2.6.1. The business case is created as a result of one or more  of the following: 78    Part 1 - Guide u n Market demand (e.g., an automobile manufacturer authorizing a project to build more fuel-efﬁcient cars in  response to gasoline shortages), u n Organizational need (e.g., due to high overhead costs, a company may combine staff functions and streamline  processes to reduce costs), u n Customer request (e.g., an electric utility authorizing a project to build a new substation to serve a new  industrial park), u n Technological advance (e.g., an airline authorizing a new project to develop electronic tickets instead of paper  tickets based on technological advances), u n Legal requirement (e.g., a paint manufacturer authorizing a project to establish guidelines for handling  toxic materials), u n Ecological impacts (e.g., a company authorizing a project to lessen its environmental impact), or u n Social need (e.g., a nongovernmental organization in a developing country authorizing a project to  provide potable water systems, latrines, and sanitation education to communities suffering from high  rates of cholera).

The tools and techniques appropriate in  a project depend on the nature of the project, especially the degree of innovation involved, the project complexity, and  the level of diversity (including diversity of disciplines) among team members. 103 Tools and techniques include but are not limited to: u u Networking, including informal social interaction and online social networking. Online forums where people  can ask open questions (“What does anyone know about…?”) are useful for starting knowledge-sharing  conversations with specialists; u u Communities of practice (sometimes called communities of interest or just communities) and special  interest groups; u u Meetings, including virtual meetings where participants can interact using communications technology; u u Work shadowing and reverse shadowing; u u Discussion forums such as focus groups; u u Knowledge-sharing events such as seminars and conferences; u u Workshops, including problem-solving sessions and learning reviews designed to identify lessons learned; u u Storytelling; u u Creativity and ideas management techniques; u u Knowledge fairs and cafés; and u u Training that involves interaction between learners. All of these tools and techniques can be applied face-to-face or virtually, or both. Face-to-face interaction is usually  the most effective way to build the trusting relationships that are needed to manage knowledge. Once relationships are  established, virtual interaction can be used to maintain the relationship. 4.4.2.3 INFORMATION MANAGEMENT Information management tools and techniques are used to create and connect people to information. They are  effective for sharing simple, unambiguous, codiﬁed explicit knowledge. They include but are not limited to: u u Methods for codifying explicit knowledge; for example, for producing lessons to be learned entries for the lessons  learned register; u u Lessons learned register; u u Library services; u u Information gathering, for example, web searches and reading published articles; and u u Project management information system (PMIS). Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information  systems often include document management systems. Tools and techniques that connect people to information can be enhanced by adding an element of interaction, for  example, include a “contact me” function so users can get in touch with the originators of the lessons and ask for advice  speciﬁc to their project and context. 104    Part 1 - Guide Interaction and support also helps people ﬁnd relevant information. Asking for help is generally quicker and easier  than trying to identify search terms. Search terms are often difﬁcult to select because people may not know which  keywords or key phrases to use to access the information they need. Knowledge and information management tools and techniques should be connected to project processes and process  owners. Communities of practice and subject matter experts (SMEs), for example, may generate insights that lead   to improved control processes; having an internal sponsor can ensure improvements are implemented. Lessons learned  register entries may be analyzed to identify common issues that can be addressed by changes to project procedures. 4.4.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS The interpersonal and team skills used include but are not limited to: u u Active listening.

To become work  performance information, the work performance data are compared with the project management plan components,  project documents, and other project variables. This comparison indicates how the project is performing. Speciﬁc work performance metrics for scope, schedule, budget, and quality are deﬁned at the start of the project  as part of the project management plan. Performance data are collected during the project through the controlling  processes and compared to the plan and other variables to provide a context for work performance. For example, work performance data on cost may include funds that have been expended. However, to be useful, that  data has to be compared to the budget, the work that was performed, the resources used to accomplish the work, and  the funding schedule. This additional information provides the context to determine if the project is on budget or if there  is a variance. It also indicates the degree of variance from the plan, and by comparing it to the variance thresholds in  the project management plan it can indicate if preventive or corrective action is required. Interpreting work performance  data and the additional information as a whole provides a context that provides a sound foundation for project decisions. 4.5.1.4 AGREEMENTS Described in Section 12.2.3.2.

5.2.2 COLLECT REQUIREMENTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES,5878,"5.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  or training in the following topics: u u Business analysis, u u Requirements elicitation, u u Requirements analysis, u u Requirements documentation, u u Project requirements in previous similar projects, u u Diagramming techniques, u u Facilitation, and u u Conﬂict management. 5.2.2.2 DATA GATHERING Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: u u Brainstorming. Described in Section 4.1.2.2. Brainstorming is a technique used to generate and collect multiple  ideas related to project and product requirements. u u Interviews. An interview is a formal or informal approach to elicit information from stakeholders by talking  to them directly. It is typically performed by asking prepared and spontaneous questions and recording the  responses. Interviews are often conducted on an individual basis between an interviewer and an interviewee, but  may involve multiple interviewers and/or multiple interviewees. Interviewing experienced project participants,  sponsors, other executives, and subject matter experts can aid in identifying and deﬁning the features and  functions of the desired product deliverables. Interviews are also useful for obtaining conﬁdential information. u u Focus groups. Focus groups bring together prequaliﬁed stakeholders and subject matter experts to learn about  their expectations and attitudes about a proposed product, service, or result. A trained moderator guides the  group through an interactive discussion designed to be more conversational than a one-on-one interview. 143 u u Questionnaires and surveys. Questionnaires and surveys are written sets of questions designed to quickly  accumulate information from a large number of respondents. Questionnaires and/or surveys are most appropriate  with varied audiences, when a quick turnaround is needed, when respondents are geographically dispersed, and  where statistical analysis could be appropriate. u u Benchmarking. Described in Section 8.1.2.2. Benchmarking involves comparing actual or planned products,  processes, and practices to those of comparable organizations to identify best practices, generate ideas for  improvement, and provide a basis for measuring performance. The organizations compared during benchmarking  can be internal or external. 5.2.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited  to document analysis. Document analysis consists of reviewing and assessing any relevant documented information.  In this process, document analysis is used to elicit requirements by analyzing existing documentation and identifying  information relevant to the requirements. There is a wide range of documents that may be analyzed to help elicit relevant  requirements. Examples of documents that may be analyzed include but are not limited to: u u Agreements; u u Business plans; u u Business process or interface documentation; u u Business rules repositories; u u Current process ﬂows; u u Marketing literature; u u Problem/issue logs; u u Policies and procedures; u u Regulatory documentation such as laws, codes, or ordinances, etc.; u u Requests for proposal; and u u Use cases. 144    Part 1 - Guide 5.2.2.4 DECISION MAKING Decision-making techniques that can be used in the Collect Requirements process include but are not limited to: u u Voting. Voting is a collective decision-making technique and an assessment process having multiple alternatives  with an expected outcome in the form of future actions. These techniques can be used to generate, classify, and  prioritize product requirements. Examples of voting techniques include: u n Unanimity. A decision that is reached whereby everyone agrees on a single course of action. u n Majority. A decision that is reached with support obtained from more than 50% of the members of the group.  Having a group size with an uneven number of participants can ensure that a decision will be reached, rather  than resulting in a tie. u n Plurality. A decision that is reached whereby the largest block in a group decides, even if a majority is not  achieved. This method is generally used when the number of options nominated is more than two.  u u Autocratic decision making. In this method, one individual takes responsibility for making the decision  for the group. u u Multicriteria decision analysis. A technique that uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic analytical  approach for establishing criteria, such as risk levels, uncertainty, and valuation, to evaluate and rank many ideas. 5.2.2.5 DATA REPRESENTATION Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: u u Affinity diagrams. Afﬁnity diagrams allow large numbers of ideas to be classiﬁed into groups for review and  analysis. u u Mind mapping. Mind mapping consolidates ideas created through individual brainstorming sessions into a  single map to reﬂect commonality and differences in understanding and to generate new ideas. 5.2.2.6 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS Described in Section 4.1.2.3. The interpersonal and team skills that can be used in this process include but are not  limited to: u u Nominal group technique. The nominal group technique enhances brainstorming with a voting process used  to rank the most useful ideas for further brainstorming or for prioritization. The nominal group technique is a  structured form of brainstorming consisting of four steps: 145 u n A question or problem is posed to the group. Each person silently generates and writes down their ideas. u n The moderator writes down the ideas on a ﬂip chart until all ideas are recorded. u n Each recorded idea is discussed until all group members have a clear understanding. u n Individuals vote privately to prioritize the ideas, usually using a scale of 1 – 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5  being the highest. Voting may take place in many rounds to reduce and focus in on ideas. After each round,  the votes are tallied and the highest scoring ideas are selected. u u Observation/conversation. Observation and conversation provide a direct way of viewing individuals in their  environment and how they perform their jobs or tasks and carry out processes. It is particularly helpful for detailed  processes when the people who use the product have difﬁculty or are reluctant to articulate their requirements.  Observation is also known as “job shadowing.” It is usually done externally by an observer viewing a business  expert performing a job. It can also be done by a “participant observer” who actually performs a process or  procedure to experience how it is done to uncover hidden requirements. u u Facilitation. Described in Section 4.1.2.3. Facilitation is used with focused sessions that bring key stakeholders  together to deﬁne product requirements. Workshops can be used to quickly deﬁne cross-functional  requirements and reconcile stakeholder differences. Because of their interactive group nature, well-facilitated  sessions can build trust, foster relationships, and improve communication among the participants, which can  lead to increased stakeholder consensus. In addition, issues can be discovered earlier and resolved more  quickly than in individual sessions. Facilitation skills are used in the following situations, but are not limited to: u n Joint application design/development (JAD). JAD sessions are used in the software development industry.  These facilitated sessions focus on bringing business subject matter experts and the development team  together to gather requirements and improve the software development process. u n Quality function deployment (QFD). In the manufacturing industry, QFD is another facilitation technique that  helps determine critical characteristics for new product development. QFD starts by collecting customer  needs, also known as voice of the customer (VOC). These needs are then objectively sorted and prioritized,  and goals are set for achieving them. u n User stories. User stories, which are short, textual descriptions of required functionality, are often developed  during a requirements workshop. User stories describe the stakeholder role, who beneﬁts from the feature  (role), what the stakeholder needs to accomplish (goal), and the beneﬁt to the stakeholder (motivation). 146    Part 1 - Guide 5.2.2.7 CONTEXT DIAGRAM The context diagram is an example of a scope model. Context diagrams visually depict the product scope by showing  a business system (process, equipment, computer system, etc.), and how people and other systems (actors) interact  with it (see Figure 5-6).

5.2.3 COLLECT REQUIREMENTS: OUTPUTS,6088,"5.2.3.1 REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION Requirements documentation describes how individual requirements meet the business need for the project.  Requirements may start out at a high level and become progressively more detailed as more information about the  requirements is known. Before being baselined, requirements need to be unambiguous (measurable and testable),  traceable, complete, consistent, and acceptable to key stakeholders. The format of the requirements document may  range from a simple document listing all the requirements categorized by stakeholder and priority, to more elaborate  forms containing an executive summary, detailed descriptions, and attachments. 148    Part 1 - Guide Many organizations categorize requirements into different types, such as business and technical solutions, the  former referring to stakeholder needs and the latter as to how those needs will be implemented. Requirements can  be grouped into classiﬁcations allowing for further reﬁnement and detail as the requirements are elaborated. These  classiﬁcations include: u u Business requirements. These describe the higher-level needs of the organization as a whole, such as the  business issues or opportunities, and reasons why a project has been undertaken. u u Stakeholder requirements. These describe needs of a stakeholder or stakeholder group. u u Solution requirements. These describe features, functions, and characteristics of the product, service, or  result that will meet the business and stakeholder requirements. Solution requirements are further grouped into  functional and nonfunctional requirements: u n Functional requirements. Functional requirements describe the behaviors of the product. Examples include  actions, processes, data, and interactions that the product should execute. u n Nonfunctional requirements. Nonfunctional requirements supplement functional requirements and describe  the environmental conditions or qualities required for the product to be effective. Examples include: reliability,  security, performance, safety, level of service, supportability, retention/purge, etc. u u Transition and readiness requirements. These describe temporary capabilities, such as data conversion and  training requirements, needed to transition from the current as-is state to the desired future state. u u Project requirements. These describe the actions, processes, or other conditions the project needs to meet.  Examples include milestone dates, contractual obligations, constraints, etc. u u Quality requirements. These capture any condition or criteria needed to validate the successful completion  of a project deliverable or fulﬁllment of other project requirements. Examples include tests, certiﬁcations,  validations, etc. 5.2.3.2 REQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY MATRIX The requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links product requirements from their origin to the deliverables  that satisfy them. The implementation of a requirements traceability matrix helps ensure that each requirement adds  business value by linking it to the business and project objectives. It provides a means to track requirements throughout  the project life cycle, helping to ensure that requirements approved in the requirements documentation are delivered at  the end of the project.

5.3.3 DEFINE SCOPE: OUTPUTS,6365,"5.3.3.1 PROJECT SCOPE STATEMENT The project scope statement is the description of the project scope, major deliverables, assumptions, and constraints.  The project scope statement documents the entire scope, including project and product scope. It describes the project’s  deliverables in detail. It also provides a common understanding of the project scope among project stakeholders. It may  contain explicit scope exclusions that can assist in managing stakeholder expectations. It enables the project team  to perform more detailed planning, guides the project team’s work during execution, and provides the baseline for  evaluating whether requests for changes or additional work are contained within or outside the project’s boundaries. The degree and level of detail to which the project scope statement deﬁnes the work that will be performed and the  work that is excluded can help determine how well the project management team can control the overall project scope.  The detailed project scope statement, either directly or by reference to other documents, includes the following: u u Product scope description. Progressively elaborates the characteristics of the product, service, or result  described in the project charter and requirements documentation. u u Deliverables. Any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required  to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables also include ancillary results, such as  project management reports and documentation. These deliverables may be described at a summary level  or in great detail. u u Acceptance criteria. A set of conditions that is required to be met before deliverables are accepted. u u Project exclusions. Identiﬁes what is excluded from the project. Explicitly stating what is out of scope for the  project helps manage stakeholders’ expectations and can reduce scope creep. Although the project charter and the project scope statement are sometimes perceived as containing a certain  degree of redundancy, they are different in the level of detail contained in each.

6.3.2 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES,7998,"6.3.2.1 PRECEDENCE DIAGRAMMING METHOD The precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activities  are represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in which  the activities are to be performed. PDM includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. A predecessor activity is an activity that logically  comes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes after  another activity in a schedule. These relationships are deﬁned below and are illustrated in Figure 6-9: 190    Part 1 - Guide u u Finish-to-start (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity  has ﬁnished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardware  is assembled (predecessor). u u Finish-to-finish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot ﬁnish until a predecessor activity  has ﬁnished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to ﬁnish before editing the document  (successor) can ﬁnish. u u Start-to-start (SS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity  has started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins. u u Start-to-finish (SF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot ﬁnish until a predecessor activity  has started. For example, a new accounts payable system (successor) has to start before the old accounts  payable system can be shut down (predecessor). In PDM, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. The SF relationship is very rarely used, but  is included to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types. Two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example, SS and FF). Multiple relationships  between the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with the  highest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships. Figure 6-9.

Dependency has four attributes, but two can be applicable at the same time in the following  ways: mandatory external dependencies, mandatory internal dependencies, discretionary external dependencies, or  discretionary internal dependencies. u u Mandatory dependencies. Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required or  inherent in the nature of the work. Mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations, such as on a  construction project, where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built,  or on an electronics project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependencies  are sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies may not be mandatory.  The project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities.  Mandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool. u u Discretionary dependencies. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic,  preferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best  practices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a speciﬁc sequence  is desired, even though there may be other acceptable sequences. For example, generally accepted best  practices recommend that during construction, the electrical work should start after ﬁnishing the plumbing  work. This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel), but performing  the activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. Discretionary dependencies should be fully  documented since they can create arbitrary total ﬂoat values and can limit later scheduling options. When fast  tracking techniques are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered for  modiﬁcation or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the process  of sequencing the activities. 192    Part 1 - Guide u u External dependencies. External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and non- project activities. These dependencies are usually outside of the project team’s control. For example, the  testing activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source, or  governmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction  project. The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of  sequencing the activities. u u Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and  are generally inside the project team’s control. For example, if the team cannot test a machine until they assemble  it, there is an internal mandatory dependency. The project management team determines which dependencies  are internal during the process of sequencing the activities. 6.3.2.3 LEADS AND LAGS A lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,  on a project to construct a new ofﬁce building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduled  punch list completion. This would be shown as a ﬁnish-to-start with a 2-week lead as shown in Figure 6-10. Lead is often  represented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software. Figure 6-10.

6.4 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS,8160,"Estimate Activity Durations is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual  activities with estimated resources. The key beneﬁt of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activity  will take to complete. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of  this process are depicted in Figure 6-12. Figure 6-13 depicts the data ﬂow diagram of the process. Figure 6-12.

Estimate Activity Durations: Data Flow Diagram Estimating activity durations uses information from the scope of work, required resource types or skill levels,  estimated resource quantities, and resource calendars. Other factors that may inﬂuence the duration estimates include  constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, or type of resources (e.g., ﬁxed duration, ﬁxed effort or work, ﬁxed  number of resources), as well as the schedule network analysis technique used. The inputs for the estimates of duration  originate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the speciﬁc  activity. The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and availability of the  input data. For example, as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work,  the accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve. 197 The Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete  the activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity. These estimates are used to  approximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project  and resource calendars. In many cases, the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an  activity, along with the skill proﬁciency of those resources, may determine the activity’s duration. A change to a driving  resource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration, but this is not a simple “straight-line” or  linear relationship. Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved,  or number of resources) will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation  (e.g., a 24-hour stress test). Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include: u u Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., resource) used to determine the effort required to produce a  unit of work is increased while all other factors remain ﬁxed, a point will eventually be reached at which additions  of that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output. u u Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources does  not always reduce the time by half, as it may increase extra duration due to risk, and at some point adding  too many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer, learning curve, additional  coordination, and other factors involved. u u Advances in technology. This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates. For example, an  increase in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology,  which may impact duration and resource needs. u u Motivation of staff. The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome—or procrastination— when people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline, and Parkinson’s Law  where work expands to ﬁll the time available for its completion.

Activity attributes may describe dened predecessor or  successor relationships, as well as dened lead and lag and logical relationships between the activities that may  impact duration estimates. u u Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on the  project, which are to be estimated. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can inuence the  duration estimates. u u Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may  give rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule. u u Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to  effort and duration estimating can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precision  of effort and duration estimates. u u Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specic milestones  that may impact the duration estimates. u u Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. The project is staffed when the appropriate people  have been assigned to the team. u u Resource breakdown structure. Described in Section 9.2.3.3. The resource breakdown structure provides a  hierarchical structure of the identied resources by resource category and resource type. 199 u u Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. The resource calendars inuence the duration of schedule  activities due to the availability of specic resources, type of resources, and resources with specic attributes.  Resource calendars specify when and how long identied project resources will be available during the project. u u Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. The estimated activity resource requirements will have  an effect on the duration of the activity, since the level to which the resources assigned to the activity meet  the requirements will signicantly inuence the duration of most activities. For example, if additional or lower skilled resources are assigned to an activity, there may be reduced efciency or productivity due to increased  communication, training, and coordination needs leading to a longer duration estimate. u u Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. Individual project risks may impact resource selection and  availability. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates, described in Section  11.5.3.2, from Plan Risk Responses. 6.4.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS The enterprise environmental factors that can inuence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are not  limited to: u u Duration estimating databases and other reference data, u u Productivity metrics, u u Published commercial information, and u u Location of team members. 6.4.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS ASSETS The organizational process assets that can inuence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are not  limited to: u u Historical duration information, u u Project calendars, u u Estimating policies, u u Scheduling methodology, and u u Lessons learned repository. 200    Part 1  Guide"
6.4.2 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES,8359,"6.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  or training in the following topics: u u Schedule development, management, and control; u u Expertise in estimating; and u u Discipline or application knowledge. 6.4.2.2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING Analogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical  data from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as  duration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future  project. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basis  for estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for known  differences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when  there is a limited amount of detailed information about the project. Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other techniques, but it is also  less accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and may  be used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous  activities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimates  have the needed expertise. 6.4.2.3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING Parametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration based  on historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data  and other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost,  budget, and duration. 201 Durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of labor  hours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied by  the number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor  hours per meter. If the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required to  install 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour). This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into  the model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction  with other estimating methods. 6.4.2.4 THREE-POINT ESTIMATING The accuracy of single-point duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk.  Using three-point estimates helps deﬁne an approximate range for an activity’s duration: u u Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned,  their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, and  interruptions. u u Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity. u u Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity. Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE,  can be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution: tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3. Triangular distribution is used when there is insufﬁcient historical data or when using judgmental data. Duration  estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range of  uncertainty around the expected duration. 202    Part 1 - Guide 6.4.2.5 BOTTOM-UP ESTIMATING Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower- level components of the WBS. When an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of conﬁdence,  the work within the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These estimates are  then aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity’s durations. Activities may or may not have dependencies  between them that can affect the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this pattern of resource  usage is reﬂected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity. 6.4.2.6 DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: u u Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to compare various levels of resource capability or skills;  scheduling compression techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.6); different tools (manual versus automated);  and make, rent, or buy decisions regarding the resources. This allows the team to weigh resource, cost, and  duration variables to determine an optimal approach for accomplishing project work. u u Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserve  needed for the project. Duration estimates may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as schedule  reserves, to account for schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration within the schedule  baseline, which is allocated for identiﬁed risks that are accepted. Contingency reserves are associated with the  known-unknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. The contingency  reserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration or a ﬁxed number of work periods. Contingency  reserves may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated. As more precise information about the  project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should be  clearly identiﬁed in the schedule documentation. Estimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of schedule for the project. Management  reserves are a speciﬁed amount of the project budget withheld for management control purposes and are  reserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address  the unknown-unknowns that can affect a project. Management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline,  but it is part of the overall project duration requirements. Depending on contract terms, use of management  reserves may require a change to the schedule baseline. 203 6.4.2.7 DECISION MAKING Described in Section 5.2.2.4. Decision-making techniques that can be used in this process include but are not limited  to voting. One variation of the voting method that is often used in agile-based projects is called the ﬁst of ﬁve (also called  ﬁst to ﬁve). In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holding  up a closed ﬁst (indicating no support) up to ﬁve ﬁngers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer than  three ﬁngers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The project manager  continues the ﬁst-of-ﬁve process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more ﬁngers) or agrees  to move on to the next decision. 6.4.2.8 MEETINGS The project team may hold meetings to estimate activity durations. When using an agile approach, it is necessary  to conduct sprint or iteration planning meetings to discuss prioritized product backlog items (user stories) and decide  which of these items the team will commit to work on in the upcoming iteration. The team breaks down user stories to  low-level tasks, with estimates in hours, and then validates that the estimates are achievable based on team capacity  over the duration (iteration). This meeting is usually held on the ﬁrst day of the iteration and is attended by the product  owner, the Scrum team, and the project manager. The outcome of the meeting includes an iteration backlog, as well as  assumptions, concerns, risks, dependencies, decisions, and actions.","6.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT Described in Section 4.1.2.1.

6.4.3 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: OUTPUTS,8462,"6.4.3.1 DURATION ESTIMATES Duration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of time periods that are required to complete  an activity, a phase, or a project.

Schedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is developed. "
6.5.3 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS,9048,"6.5.3.1 SCHEDULE BASELINE A schedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through formal change  control procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is accepted and approved by the appropriate  stakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline ﬁnish dates. During monitoring and  controlling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and ﬁnish dates to determine if variances have  occurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan. 6.5.3.2 PROJECT SCHEDULE The project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations,  milestones, and resources. At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned ﬁnish date  for each activity. If resource planning is done at an early stage, the project schedule remains preliminary until resource  assignments have been conﬁrmed and scheduled start and ﬁnish dates are established. This process usually occurs no  later than the completion of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1). A target project schedule model may also  be developed with a deﬁned target start and target ﬁnish for each activity. The project schedule may be presented in  summary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. Although  a project schedule model can be presented in tabular form, it is more often presented graphically, using one or more of  the following formats: u u Bar charts. Also known as Gantt charts, bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listed  on the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as horizontal  bars placed according to start and ﬁnish dates. Bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used.  Depending on the audience, ﬂoat can be depicted or not. For control and management communications, the  broader, more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependent  work packages and is displayed in bar chart reports. An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 6-21  that is presented in a WBS-structured format. 218    Part 1 - Guide u u Milestone charts. These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion of  major deliverables and key external interfaces. An example is the milestone schedule portion of Figure 6-21. u u Project schedule network diagrams. These diagrams are commonly presented in the activity-on-node  diagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a pure  logic diagram, as shown in Figure 6-11, or presented in a time-scaled schedule network diagram format that  is sometimes called a logic bar chart, as shown for the detailed schedule in Figure 6-21. These diagrams, with  activity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project’s critical path schedule  activities. This example also shows how each work package is planned as a series of related activities.  Another presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a time-scaled logic diagram. These diagrams  include a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. They are  optimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on the  same line of the diagram in sequence.  Figure 6-21 shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed, with the work in progress reported  through as-of date or status date. For a simple project schedule model, Figure 6-21 reﬂects schedule presentations in  the forms of (1) a milestone schedule as a milestone chart, (2) a summary schedule as a bar chart, and (3) a detailed  schedule as a project schedule linked bar chart diagram. Figure 6-21 also visually shows the relationships among the  different levels of detail of the project schedule.

Schedule performance measurements such as schedule  variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original  schedule baseline. u u Iteration burndown chart. This chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. It  is used to analyze the variance with respect to an ideal burndown based on the work committed from iteration  planning (see Section 6.4.2.8). A forecast trend line can be used to predict the likely variance at iteration  completion and take appropriate actions during the course of the iteration. A diagonal line representing the ideal  burndown and daily actual remaining work is then plotted. A trend line is then calculated to forecast completion  based on remaining work. Figure 6-24 is an example of an iteration burndown chart. Figure 6-24.

Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze schedule performance against  the schedule baseline such as actual start and ﬁnish dates, percent complete, and remaining duration for work  in progress. u u Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine  whether performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding  performance to date and for comparing to future performance goals in the form of completion dates. u u Variance analysis. Variance analysis looks at variances in planned versus actual start and ﬁnish dates, planned  versus actual durations, and variances in ﬂoat. Part of variance analysis is determining the cause and degree of  variance relative to the schedule baseline (see Section 6.5.3.1), estimating the implications of those variances  for future work to completion, and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. For example, a  major delay on any activity not on the critical path may have little effect on the overall project schedule, while a  much shorter delay on a critical or near-critical activity may require immediate action. u u What-if scenario analysis. Described in Section 6.5.2.4. What-if scenario analysis is used to assess the various  scenarios guided by the output from the Project Risk Management processes to bring the schedule model into  alignment with the project management plan and approved baseline. 6.6.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHOD Described in Section 6.5.2.2. Comparing the progress along the critical path can help determine schedule status. The  variance on the critical path will have a direct impact on the project end date.

7.1.3 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS,9994,"7.1.3.1 COST MANAGEMENT PLAN The cost management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how the project costs will  be planned, structured, and controlled. The cost management processes and their associated tools and techniques are  documented in the cost management plan. For example, the cost management plan can establish the following: u u Units of measure. Each unit used in measurements (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures;  meters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures; or lump sum in currency form) is deﬁned  for each of the resources. u u Level of precision. This is the degree to which cost estimates will be rounded up or down (e.g., US$995.59 to  US$1,000), based on the scope of the activities and magnitude of the project. u u Level of accuracy. The acceptable range (e.g., ±10%) used in determining realistic cost estimates is speciﬁed,  and may include an amount for contingencies. 239 u u Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the  framework for the cost management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates, budgets, and control  of costs. The WBS component used for the project cost accounting is called the control account. Each  control account is assigned a unique code or account number(s) that links directly to the performing  organization’s accounting system. u u Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring cost performance may be speciﬁed to indicate an  agreed-upon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically  expressed as percentage deviations from the baseline plan. u u Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules of performance measurement are  set. For example, the cost management plan may: u n Deﬁne the points in the WBS at which measurement of control accounts will be performed; u n Establish the EVM techniques (e.g., weighted milestones, ﬁxed-formula, percent complete, etc.) to be  employed; and u n Specify tracking methodologies and the EVM computation equations for calculating projected estimate at  completion (EAC) forecasts to provide a validity check on the bottom-up EAC. u u Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various cost reports are deﬁned. u u Additional details.

7.2.2 ESTIMATE COSTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES,10201,"7.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT Described in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  or training in the following topics: u u Previous similar projects; u u Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; and u u Cost estimating methods. 244    Part 1 - Guide 7.2.2.2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING Described in Section 6.4.2.2. Analogous cost estimating uses values, or attributes, of a previous project that are  similar to the current project. Values and attributes of the projects may include but are not limited to: scope, cost, budget,  duration, and measures of scale (e.g., size, weight). Comparison of these project values, or attributes, becomes the basis  for estimating the same parameter or measurement for the current project.  7.2.2.3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING Described in Section 6.4.2.3. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between relevant historical data  and other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate a cost estimate for project work. This technique can  produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model. Parametric  cost estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction with other estimating methods. 7.2.2.4 BOTTOM-UP ESTIMATING Described in Section 6.4.2.5. Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating a component of work. The cost  of individual work packages or activities is estimated to the greatest level of specified detail. The detailed cost  is then summarized or “rolled up” to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. The cost and  accuracy of bottom-up cost estimating are typically influenced by the size or other attributes of the individual  activity or work package. 7.2.2.5 THREE-POINT ESTIMATING Described in Section 6.4.2.4. The accuracy of single-point cost estimates may be improved by considering estimation  uncertainty and risk and using three estimates to deﬁne an approximate range for an activity’s cost: u u Most likely (cM). The cost of the activity, based on realistic effort assessment for the required work and any  predicted expenses. u u Optimistic (cO). The cost based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the activity. u u Pessimistic (cP). The cost based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity. 245 Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected cost, cE, can  be calculated using a formula. Two commonly used formulas are triangular and beta distributions. The formulas are: u u Triangular distribution. cE = (cO + cM + cP) / 3 u u Beta distribution. cE = (cO + 4cM + cP) / 6 Cost estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected cost and clarify the range of  uncertainty around the expected cost. 7.2.2.6 DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to: u u Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is a technique used to evaluate identiﬁed options in order to select  which options or approaches to use to execute and perform the work of the project. An example would be  evaluating the cost, schedule, resource, and quality impacts of buying versus making a deliverable. u u Reserve analysis. Cost estimates may include contingency reserves (sometimes called contingency allowances)  to account for cost uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that is allocated for  identiﬁed risks. Contingency reserves are often viewed as the part of the budget intended to address the known- unknowns that can affect a project. For example, rework for some project deliverables could be anticipated, while  the amount of this rework is unknown. Contingency reserves may be estimated to account for this unknown  amount of rework. Contingency reserves can be provided at any level from the speciﬁc activity to the entire  project. The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the estimated cost, a ﬁxed number, or may be developed  by using quantitative analysis methods. As more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced,  or eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identiﬁed in cost documentation. Contingency reserves are part of  the cost baseline and the overall funding requirements for the project. u u Cost of quality. Assumptions about costs of quality (Section 8.1.2.3) may be used to prepare the estimates. This  includes evaluating the cost impact of additional investment in conformance versus the cost of nonconformance.  It can also include looking at short-term cost reductions versus the implication of more frequent problems later  on in the product life cycle. 246    Part 1 - Guide 7.2.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS) Described in Section 4.3.2.2. The project management information system can include spreadsheets, simulation  software, and statistical analysis tools to assist with cost estimating. Such tools simplify the use of some cost-estimating  techniques and thereby facilitate rapid consideration of cost estimate alternatives. 7.2.2.8 DECISION MAKING The decision-making techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to voting.  Described in Section 5.2.2.4, voting is an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome in  the form of future actions. These techniques are useful for engaging team members to improve estimate accuracy and  commitment to the emerging estimates.","7.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT Described in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  or training in the following topics: u u Previous similar projects; u u Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; and u u Cost estimating methods. 244    Part 1  Guide 7.2.2.2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING Described in Section 6.4.2.2.

Management reserves are an amount of  the project budget withheld for management control purposes and are reserved for unforeseen work that is within  scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address the unknown unknowns that can affect a project.  The management reserve is not included in the cost baseline but is part of the overall project budget and funding  requirements. When an amount of management reserves is used to fund unforeseen work, the amount of management  reserve used is added to the cost baseline, thus requiring an approved change to the cost baseline. 253 7.3.2.4 HISTORICAL INFORMATION REVIEW Reviewing historical information can assist in developing parametric estimates or analogous estimates. Historical  information may include project characteristics (parameters) to develop mathematical models to predict total project  costs. Such models may be simple (e.g., residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space)  or complex (e.g., one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment factors, each of which  has numerous points within it). Both the cost and accuracy of analogous and parametric models can vary widely.

7.3.3 DETERMINE BUDGET: OUTPUTS,10526,"7.3.3.1 COST BASELINE The cost baseline is the approved version of the time-phased project budget, excluding any management reserves,  which can only be changed through formal change control procedures. It is used as a basis for comparison to actual  results. The cost baseline is developed as a summation of the approved budgets for the different schedule activities. Figure 7-8 illustrates the various components of the project budget and cost baseline. Cost estimates for the various  project activities, along with any contingency reserves (see Section 7.2.2.6) for these activities, are aggregated  into their associated work package costs. The work package cost estimates, along with any contingency reserves  estimated for the work packages, are aggregated into control accounts. The summation of the control accounts  make up the cost baseline. Since the cost estimates that make up the cost baseline are directly tied to the schedule  activities, this enables a time-phased view of the cost baseline, which is typically displayed in the form of an S-curve,  as is illustrated in Figure 7-9. For projects that use earned value management, the cost baseline is referred to as the  performance measurement baseline. Management reserves (Section 7.2.2.3) are added to the cost baseline to produce the project budget. As changes  warranting the use of management reserves arise, the change control process is used to obtain approval to move the  applicable management reserve funds into the cost baseline.

7.4.2 CONTROL COSTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES,10758,"7.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Examples of expert judgment during the Control Costs process include but are not  limited to: u u Variance analysis, u u Earned value analysis, u u Forecasting, and u u Financial analysis. 261 7.4.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis techniques that can be used to control costs include but are not limited to: u u Earned value analysis (EVA). Earned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline to the  actual schedule and cost performance. EVM integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedule  baseline to form the performance measurement baseline. EVM develops and monitors three key dimensions for  each work package and control account: u n Planned value. Planned value (PV) is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. It is the authorized  budget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure (WBS) component,  not including management reserve. This budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project, but at a given  point in time, planned value deﬁnes the physical work that should have been accomplished. The total of the  PV is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The total planned value for the  project is also known as budget at completion (BAC). u n Earned value. Earned value (EV) is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized  for that work. It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. The EV being  measured needs to be related to the PMB, and the EV measured cannot be greater than the authorized  PV budget for a component. The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. Progress  measurement criteria should be established for each WBS component to measure work in progress. Project  managers monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the long- term performance trends. u n Actual cost. Actual cost (AC) is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a  speciﬁc time period. It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured. The AC  needs to correspond in deﬁnition to what was budgeted in the PV and measured in the EV (e.g., direct hours  only, direct costs only, or all costs including indirect costs). The AC will have no upper limit; whatever is spent  to achieve the EV will be measured. 262    Part 1 - Guide u u Variance analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Variance analysis, as used in EVM, is the explanation (cause,  impact, and corrective actions) for cost (CV = EV – AC), schedule (SV = EV – PV), and variance at completion  (VAC = BAC – EAC) variances. Cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements.  For projects not using formal earned value analysis, similar variance analyses can be performed by comparing  planned cost against actual cost to identify variances between the cost baseline and actual project performance.  Further analysis can be performed to determine the cause and degree of variance relative to the schedule  baseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed. Cost performance measurements are used to assess  the magnitude of variation to the original cost baseline. An important aspect of project cost control includes  determining the cause and degree of variance relative to the cost baseline (see Section 7.3.3.1) and deciding  whether corrective or preventive action is required. The percentage range of acceptable variances will tend to  decrease as more work is accomplished. Examples of variance analysis include but are not limited to: u n Schedule variance. Schedule variance (SV) is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the difference  between the earned value and the planned value. It is the amount by which the project is ahead or behind  the planned delivery date, at a given point in time. It is a measure of schedule performance on a project. It  is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the planned value (PV). The EVA schedule variance is a useful metric  in that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. The EVA schedule  variance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the planned values will have  been earned. Schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path method (CPM) scheduling and  risk management. Equation: SV = EV – PV. u n Cost variance. Cost variance (CV) is the amount of budget deﬁcit or surplus at a given point in time, expressed  as the difference between earned value and the actual cost. It is a measure of cost performance on a project.  It is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the actual cost (AC). The cost variance at the end of the project will  be the difference between the budget at completion (BAC) and the actual amount spent. The CV is particularly  critical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent. Negative CV is often  difﬁcult for the project to recover. Equation: CV = EV – AC. 263 u n Schedule performance index. The schedule performance index (SPI) is a measure of schedule efﬁciency  expressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value. It measures how efﬁciently the project team is  accomplishing the work. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index (CPI) to forecast  the ﬁnal project completion estimates. An SPI value less than 1.0 indicates less work was completed than  was planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 indicates that more work was completed than was planned. Since the  SPI measures all project work, the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determine  whether the project will ﬁnish ahead of or behind its planned ﬁnish date. The SPI is equal to the ratio of the  EV to the PV. Equation: SPI = EV/PV. u n Cost performance index. The cost performance index (CPI) is a measure of the cost efﬁciency of budgeted  resources, expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. It is considered the most critical EVA metric  and measures the cost efﬁciency for the work completed. A CPI value of less than 1.0 indicates a cost overrun  for work completed. A CPI value greater than 1.0 indicates a cost underrun of performance to date. The CPI is  equal to the ratio of the EV to the AC. Equation: CPI = EV/AC. u u Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine  if performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding  performance to date and for comparison to future performance goals in the form of BAC versus estimate at  completion (EAC) and completion dates. Examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to: u n Charts. In earned value analysis, three parameters of planned value, earned value, and actual cost can be  monitored and reported on both a period-by-period basis (typically weekly or monthly) and on a cumulative  basis. Figure 7-12 uses S-curves to display EV data for a project that is performing over budget and behind  the schedule. 264    Part 1 - Guide Figure 7-12. Earned Value, Planned Value, and Actual Costs u n Forecasting. As the project progresses, the project team may develop a forecast for the estimate at completion  (EAC) that may differ from the budget at completion (BAC) based on the project performance. If it becomes  obvious that the BAC is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Forecasting  the EAC involves making projections of conditions and events in the project’s future based on current  performance information and other knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are generated,  updated, and reissued based on work performance data (Section 4.3.3.2) that is provided as the project is  executed. The work performance information covers the project’s past performance and any information that  could impact the project in the future. EACs are typically based on the actual costs incurred for work completed, plus an estimate to complete (ETC)  the remaining work. It is incumbent on the project team to predict what it may encounter to perform the ETC,  based on its experience to date. Earned value analysis works well in conjunction with manual forecasts of the  required EAC costs. The most common EAC forecasting approach is a manual, bottom-up summation by the  project manager and project team. The project manager’s bottom-up EAC method builds upon the actual costs and experience incurred for   the work completed, and requires a new estimate to complete the remaining project work. Equation: EAC =  AC + Bottom-up ETC. BAC ETC Project Budget Management Reserve Planned Value (PV) Earned Value (EV) Actual Cost (AC) EAC Time Cumulative Cost Data Date 265 The project manager’s manual EAC is quickly compared with a range of calculated EACs representing  various risk scenarios. When calculating EAC values, the cumulative CPI and SPI values are typically  used. While EVM data quickly provide many statistical EACs, only three of the more common methods are  described as follows: u m EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the budgeted rate. This EAC method accepts the actual project  performance to date (whether favorable or unfavorable) as represented by the actual costs, and predicts  that all future ETC work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. When actual performance is unfavorable,  the assumption that future performance will improve should be accepted only when supported by project  risk analysis. Equation: EAC = AC + (BAC – EV). u m EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the present CPI. This method assumes that what the project has  experienced to date can be expected to continue in the future. The ETC work is assumed to be performed  at the same cumulative cost performance index (CPI) as that incurred by the project to date. Equation:  EAC = BAC / CPI. u m EAC forecast for ETC work considering both SPI and CPI factors. In this forecast, the ETC work will be  performed at an efﬁciency rate that considers both the cost and schedule performance indices. This  method is most useful when the project schedule is a factor impacting the ETC effort. Variations of this  method weight the CPI and SPI at different values (e.g., 80/20, 50/50, or some other ratio) according to  the project manager’s judgment. Equation: EAC = AC + [(BAC – EV) / (CPI × SPI)]. u u Reserve analysis. Described in Section 7.2.2.6. During cost control, reserve analysis is used to monitor the  status of contingency and management reserves for the project to determine if these reserves are still needed or  if additional reserves need to be requested. As work on the project progresses, these reserves may be used as  planned to cover the cost of risk responses or other contingencies. Conversely, when opportunities are captured  and resulting in cost savings, funds may be added to the contingency amount, or taken from the project as  margin/proﬁt. If the identiﬁed risks do not occur, the unused contingency reserves may be removed from the project budget to  free up resources for other projects or operations. Additional risk analysis during the project may reveal a need  to request that additional reserves be added to the project budget. ","7.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT Described in Section 4.1.2.1.

The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. Progress  measurement criteria should be established for each WBS component to measure work in progress. Project  managers monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the long term performance trends. u n Actual cost. Actual cost  is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a  specic time period. It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured. The AC  needs to correspond in denition to what was budgeted in the PV and measured in the EV . The AC will have no upper limit; whatever is spent  to achieve the EV will be measured. 262    Part 1  Guide u u Variance analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2.

The cost variance at the end of the project will  be the difference between the budget at completion  and the actual amount spent. The CV is particularly  critical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent. Negative CV is often  difcult for the project to recover. Equation: CV  EV  AC. 263 u n Schedule performance index. The schedule performance index  is a measure of schedule efciency  expressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value. It measures how efciently the project team is  accomplishing the work. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index  to forecast  the nal project completion estimates. An SPI value less than 1.0 indicates less work was completed than  was planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 indicates that more work was completed than was planned. Since the  SPI measures all project work, the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determine  whether the project will nish ahead of or behind its planned nish date. The SPI is equal to the ratio of the  EV to the PV. Equation: SPI  EVPV. u n Cost performance index. The cost performance index  is a measure of the cost efciency of budgeted  resources, expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. It is considered the most critical EVA metric  and measures the cost efciency for the work completed. A CPI value of less than 1.0 indicates a cost overrun  for work completed. A CPI value greater than 1.0 indicates a cost underrun of performance to date. The CPI is  equal to the ratio of the EV to the AC. Equation: CPI  EVAC. u u Trend analysis.

Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding  performance to date and for comparison to future performance goals in the form of BAC versus estimate at  completion  and completion dates. Examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to: u n Charts. In earned value analysis, three parameters of planned value, earned value, and actual cost can be  monitored and reported on both a periodbyperiod basis  and on a cumulative  basis. Earned Value, Planned Value, and Actual Costs u n Forecasting. As the project progresses, the project team may develop a forecast for the estimate at completion   that may differ from the budget at completion  based on the project performance. If it becomes  obvious that the BAC is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Forecasting  the EAC involves making projections of conditions and events in the projects future based on current  performance information and other knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are generated,  updated, and reissued based on work performance data  that is provided as the project is  executed. The work performance information covers the projects past performance and any information that  could impact the project in the future. EACs are typically based on the actual costs incurred for work completed, plus an estimate to complete   the remaining work. It is incumbent on the project team to predict what it may encounter to perform the ETC,  based on its experience to date. Earned value analysis works well in conjunction with manual forecasts of the  required EAC costs. The most common EAC forecasting approach is a manual, bottomup summation by the  project manager and project team. The project managers bottomup EAC method builds upon the actual costs and experience incurred for   the work completed, and requires a new estimate to complete the remaining project work. Equation: EAC   AC  Bottomup ETC. BAC ETC Project Budget Management Reserve Planned Value  Earned Value  Actual Cost  EAC Time Cumulative Cost Data Date 265 The project managers manual EAC is quickly compared with a range of calculated EACs representing  various risk scenarios. When calculating EAC values, the cumulative CPI and SPI values are typically  used. While EVM data quickly provide many statistical EACs, only three of the more common methods are  described as follows: u m EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the budgeted rate. This EAC method accepts the actual project  performance to date  as represented by the actual costs, and predicts  that all future ETC work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. When actual performance is unfavorable,  the assumption that future performance will improve should be accepted only when supported by project  risk analysis. Equation: EAC  AC  . u m EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the present CPI. This method assumes that what the project has  experienced to date can be expected to continue in the future. The ETC work is assumed to be performed  at the same cumulative cost performance index  as that incurred by the project to date. Equation:  EAC  BAC  CPI. u m EAC forecast for ETC work considering both SPI and CPI factors. In this forecast, the ETC work will be  performed at an efciency rate that considers both the cost and schedule performance indices. This  method is most useful when the project schedule is a factor impacting the ETC effort. Variations of this  method weight the CPI and SPI at different values  according to  the project managers judgment. Equation: EAC  AC  . u u Reserve analysis. Described in Section 7.2.2.6. During cost control, reserve analysis is used to monitor the  status of contingency and management reserves for the project to determine if these reserves are still needed or  if additional reserves need to be requested. As work on the project progresses, these reserves may be used as  planned to cover the cost of risk responses or other contingencies. Conversely, when opportunities are captured  and resulting in cost savings, funds may be added to the contingency amount, or taken from the project as  marginprot. If the identied risks do not occur, the unused contingency reserves may be removed from the project budget to  free up resources for other projects or operations. Additional risk analysis during the project may reveal a need  to request that additional reserves be added to the project budget. "
7.4.3 CONTROL COSTS: OUTPUTS,11150,"7.4.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION Described in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project work is  performing compared to the cost baseline.

8.2.2 MANAGE QUALITY: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES,12139,"8.2.2.1 DATA GATHERING A data-gathering technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to checklists (see Section  11.2.2.2). A checklist is a structured tool, usually component-speciﬁc, used to verify that a set of required steps has  been performed or to check if a list of requirements has been satisﬁed. Based on the project’s requirements and  practices, checklists may be simple or complex. Many organizations have standardized checklists available to ensure  consistency in frequently performed tasks. In some application areas, checklists are also available from professional  associations or commercial service providers. Quality checklists should incorporate the acceptance criteria included in  the scope baseline. 8.2.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: u u Alternatives analysis. Described in Section 9.2.2.5. This technique is used to evaluate identiﬁed options in order  to select which different quality options or approaches are most appropriate to use. u u Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. The analysis of different documents produced as part of  the output of project control processes, such as quality reports, test reports, performance reports, and variance  analysis, can point to and focus on processes that may be out of control and may jeopardize meeting the  speciﬁed requirements or stakeholders’ expectations. u u Process analysis. Process analysis identiﬁes opportunities for process improvements. This analysis also  examines problems, constraints, and non-value-added activities that occur during a process. u u Root cause analysis (RCA). Root cause analysis is an analytical technique used to determine the basic underlying  reason that causes a variance, defect, or risk. A root cause may underlie more than one variance, defect, or risk. It  may also be used as a technique for identifying root causes of a problem and solving them. When all root causes  for a problem are removed, the problem does not recur. 293 8.2.2.3 DECISION MAKING A decision-making technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to multicriteria decision  analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.4. Multicriteria decision making is used to evaluate several criteria when discussing  alternatives that impact project or product quality. Project decisions can include choosing among different implementation  scenarios or suppliers. Product decisions can include evaluating the life cycle cost, schedule, stakeholder satisfaction,  and risks associated with resolving product defects. 8.2.2.4 DATA REPRESENTATION Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: u u Affinity diagrams. Described in Section 5.2.2.5. Afﬁnity diagrams can organize potential causes of defects into  groups showing areas that should be focused on the most. u u Cause-and-effect diagrams. Cause-and-effect diagrams are also known as ﬁshbone diagrams, why-why  diagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement identiﬁed  into discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem. Figure 8-9 is an example of a  cause-and-effect diagram. u u Flowcharts. Described in Section 8.1.2.5. Flowcharts show a series of steps that lead to a defect. u u Histograms. Histograms show a graphical representation of numerical data. Histograms can show the number  of defects per deliverable, a ranking of the cause of defects, the number of times each process is noncompliant,  or other representations of project or product defects. u u Matrix diagrams. Described in Section 8.1.2.5. The matrix diagram seeks to show the strength of relationships  among factors, causes, and objectives that exist between the rows and columns that form the matrix. u u Scatter diagrams. A scatter diagram is a graph that shows the relationship between two variables. Scatter  diagrams can demonstrate a relationship between any element of a process, environment, or activity on one axis  and a quality defect on the other axis. 294    Part 1 - Guide Figure 8-9. Cause-and-Effect Diagram 8.2.2.5 AUDITS An audit is a structured, independent process used to determine if project activities comply with organizational and  project policies, processes, and procedures. A quality audit is usually conducted by a team external to the project,  such as the organization’s internal audit department, PMO, or by an auditor external to the organization. Quality audit  objectives may include but are not limited to: u u Identifying all good and best practices being implemented; u u Identifying all nonconformity, gaps, and shortcomings; u u Sharing good practices introduced or implemented in similar projects in the organization and/or industry; u u Proactively offering assistance in a positive manner to improve the implementation of processes to help raise  team productivity; and u u Highlighting contributions of each audit in the lessons learned repository of the organization.

Quality audits may be scheduled or random, and may be conducted by  internal or external auditors. Quality audits can conﬁrm the implementation of approved change requests including updates, corrective actions,  defect repairs, and preventive actions. 8.2.2.6 DESIGN FOR X Design for X (DfX) is a set of technical guidelines that may be applied during the design of a product for the optimization  of a speciﬁc aspect of the design. DfX can control or even improve the product’s ﬁnal characteristics. The X in DfX can  be different aspects of product development, such as reliability, deployment, assembly, manufacturing, cost, service,  usability, safety, and quality. Using the DfX may result in cost reduction, quality improvement, better performance, and  customer satisfaction. 8.2.2.7 PROBLEM SOLVING Problem solving entails ﬁnding solutions for issues or challenges. It can include gathering additional information,  critical thinking, creative, quantitative and/or logical approaches. Effective and systematic problem solving is a  fundamental element in quality assurance and quality improvement. Problems can arise as a result of the Control Quality  process or from quality audits and can be associated with a process or deliverable. Using a structured problem-solving  method will help eliminate the problem and develop a long-lasting solution. Problem-solving methods generally include  the following elements: u u Deﬁning the problem, u u Identifying the root-cause, u u Generating possible solutions, u u Choosing the best solution, u u Implementing the solution, and u u Verifying solution effectiveness. 296    Part 1 - Guide 8.2.2.8 QUALITY IMPROVEMENT METHODS Quality improvements can occur based on ﬁndings and recommendations from quality control processes, the ﬁndings  of the quality audits, or problem solving in the Manage Quality process.

A checklist is a structured tool, usually componentspecic, used to verify that a set of required steps has  been performed or to check if a list of requirements has been satised. Based on the projects requirements and  practices, checklists may be simple or complex. Many organizations have standardized checklists available to ensure  consistency in frequently performed tasks. In some application areas, checklists are also available from professional  associations or commercial service providers. Quality checklists should incorporate the acceptance criteria included in  the scope baseline. 8.2.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: u u Alternatives analysis. Described in Section 9.2.2.5. This technique is used to evaluate identied options in order  to select which different quality options or approaches are most appropriate to use. u u Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. The analysis of different documents produced as part of  the output of project control processes, such as quality reports, test reports, performance reports, and variance  analysis, can point to and focus on processes that may be out of control and may jeopardize meeting the  specied requirements or stakeholders expectations. u u Process analysis. Process analysis identies opportunities for process improvements. This analysis also  examines problems, constraints, and nonvalueadded activities that occur during a process. u u Root cause analysis . Root cause analysis is an analytical technique used to determine the basic underlying  reason that causes a variance, defect, or risk. A root cause may underlie more than one variance, defect, or risk. It  may also be used as a technique for identifying root causes of a problem and solving them. When all root causes  for a problem are removed, the problem does not recur. 293 8.2.2.3 DECISION MAKING A decisionmaking technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to multicriteria decision  analysis. Described in Section 8.1.2.4. Multicriteria decision making is used to evaluate several criteria when discussing  alternatives that impact project or product quality. Project decisions can include choosing among different implementation  scenarios or suppliers. Product decisions can include evaluating the life cycle cost, schedule, stakeholder satisfaction,  and risks associated with resolving product defects. 8.2.2.4 DATA REPRESENTATION Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: u u Affinity diagrams. Described in Section 5.2.2.5. Afnity diagrams can organize potential causes of defects into  groups showing areas that should be focused on the most. u u Causeandeffect diagrams. Causeandeffect diagrams are also known as shbone diagrams, whywhy  diagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement identied  into discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem. u u Flowcharts. Described in Section 8.1.2.5. Flowcharts show a series of steps that lead to a defect. u u Histograms. Histograms show a graphical representation of numerical data. Histograms can show the number  of defects per deliverable, a ranking of the cause of defects, the number of times each process is noncompliant,  or other representations of project or product defects. u u Matrix diagrams. Described in Section 8.1.2.5. The matrix diagram seeks to show the strength of relationships  among factors, causes, and objectives that exist between the rows and columns that form the matrix. u u Scatter diagrams. A scatter diagram is a graph that shows the relationship between two variables. Scatter  diagrams can demonstrate a relationship between any element of a process, environment, or activity on one axis  and a quality defect on the other axis.

Described in Section 11.2.2.2. Checklists help in managing the control quality activities in a  structured manner. u u Check sheets. Check sheets are also known as tally sheets and are used to organize facts in a manner that will  facilitate the effective collection of useful data about a potential quality problem. They are especially useful for  gathering attributes data while performing inspections to identify defects; for example, data about the frequencies  or consequences of defects collected. See Figure 8-12. Figure 8-12.

Statistical sampling involves choosing part of a population of interest for inspection (for  example, selecting 10 engineering drawings at random from a list of 75). The sample is taken to measure controls  and verify quality. Sample frequency and sizes should be determined during the Plan Quality Management process. u u Questionnaires and Surveys. Surveys may be used to gather data about customer satisfaction after the  deployment of the product or service. The cost regarding defects identiﬁed in the surveys may be considered  external failure costs in the COQ model and can have extensive cost implications for the organization. 8.3.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: u u Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze the quality metrics deﬁned by the  Plan Quality Management process against the actual results. u u Root cause analysis (RCA). Described in Section 8.2.2.2. Root cause analysis is used to identify the source  of defects. 8.3.2.3 INSPECTION An inspection is the examination of a work product to determine if it conforms to documented standards. The results  of inspections generally include measurements and may be conducted at any level. The results of a single activity can be  inspected, or the ﬁnal product of the project can be inspected. Inspections may be called reviews, peer reviews, audits,  or walkthroughs. In some application areas, these terms have narrow and speciﬁc meanings. Inspections also are used  to verify defect repairs. 8.3.2.4 TESTING/PRODUCT EVALUATIONS Testing is an organized and constructed investigation conducted to provide objective information about the quality  of the product or service under test in accordance with the project requirements. The intent of testing is to ﬁnd errors,  defects, bugs, or other nonconformance problems in the product or service. The type, amount, and extent of tests  needed to evaluate each requirement are part of the project quality plan and depend on the nature of the project, time,  budget, and other constraints. Tests can be performed throughout the project, as different components of the project  become available, and at the end of the project on the ﬁnal deliverables. Early testing helps identify nonconformance  problems and helps reduce the cost of ﬁxing the nonconforming components. 304    Part 1 - Guide Different application areas require different tests. For example, software testing may include unit testing, integration  testing, black-box, white-box, interface testing, regression testing, Alpha testing, etc. In construction projects, testing  may include cement strength, concrete workability test, nondestructive tests at construction sites for testing the quality  of hardened concrete structures, and soil tests. In hardware development, testing may include environmental stress  screening, burn-in tests, system testing, and more. 8.3.2.5 DATA REPRESENTATION Data representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: u u Cause-and-effect diagrams. Described in Section 8.2.2.4. Cause-and-effect diagrams are used to identify the  possible effects of quality defects and errors. u u Control charts. Control charts are used to determine whether or not a process is stable or has predictable  performance. Upper and lower speciﬁcation limits are based on the requirements and reﬂect the maximum and  minimum values allowed. Upper and lower control limits are different from speciﬁcation limits. The control limits  are determined using standard statistical calculations and principles to ultimately establish the natural capability  for a stable process. The project manager and appropriate stakeholders may use the statistically calculated  control limits to identify the points at which corrective action will be taken to prevent performance that remains  outside the control limits. Control charts can be used to monitor various types of output variables. Although used  most frequently to track repetitive activities required for producing manufactured lots, control charts may also be  used to monitor cost and schedule variances, volume, frequency of scope changes, or other management results  to help determine if the project management processes are in control. u u Histograms. Described in Section 8.2.2.4. Histograms can demonstrate the number of defects by source  or by component. u u Scatter diagrams. Described in Section 8.2.2.4.

Various formats  exist to document and communicate team member roles and responsibilities. Most fall into hierarchical, matrix, or text- oriented formats. Some project assignments are listed in subsidiary plans, such as the risk, quality, or communications  management plans. Regardless of the method used to document team member roles, the objective is to ensure that  each work package has an unambiguous owner and that all team members have a clear understanding of their roles  and responsibilities. A hierarchical format may be used to represent high-level roles, while a text-based format may be  better suited to document the detailed responsibilities. u u Hierarchical charts. The traditional organizational chart structure can be used to show positions and relationships  in a graphical, top-down format. u n Work breakdown structures (WBS). The WBS is designed to show how project deliverables are broken down  into work packages and provide a way of showing high-level areas of responsibility. u n Organizational breakdown structure (OBS). While the WBS shows a breakdown of project deliverables, an OBS  is arranged according to an organization’s existing departments, units, or teams, with the project activities or  work packages listed under each department. An operational department, such as information technology or  purchasing, can see all of its project responsibilities by looking at its portion of the OBS. u n Resource breakdown structure. The resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical list of team and physical  resources related by category and resource type that is used for planning, managing and controlling project  work. Each descending (lower) level represents an increasingly detailed description of the resource until the  information is small enough to be used in conjunction with the work breakdown structure (WBS) to allow the  work to be planned, monitored, and controlled. 317 u u Assignment Matrix. A RAM shows the project resources assigned to each work package. It is used to illustrate  the connections between work packages, or activities, and project team members. On larger projects, RAMs can  be developed at various levels. For example, a high-level RAM can deﬁne the responsibilities of a project team,  group, or unit within each component of the WBS. Lower-level RAMs are used within the group to designate roles,  responsibilities, and levels of authority for speciﬁc activities. The matrix format shows all activities associated  with one person and all people associated with one activity. This also ensures that there is only one person  accountable for any one task to avoid confusion about who is ultimately in charge or has authority for the work.  One example of a RAM is a RACI (responsible, accountable, consult, and inform) chart, shown in Figure 9-4.  The sample chart shows the work to be done in the left column as activities. The assigned resources can be  shown as individuals or groups. The project manager can select other options, such as “lead” and “resource”  designations, as appropriate for the project. A RACI chart is a useful tool to use to ensure clear assignment of  roles and responsibilities when the team consists of internal and external resources. u u Text-oriented formats. Team member responsibilities that require detailed descriptions can be speciﬁed in text- oriented formats. Usually in outline form, these documents provide information such as responsibilities, authority,  competencies, and qualiﬁcations. The documents are known by various names including position descriptions  and role-responsibility-authority forms. These documents can be used as templates for future projects, especially  when the information is updated throughout the current project by applying lessons learned. Figure 9-4.

9.3.2 ACQUIRE RESOURCES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES,13887,"9.3.2.1 DECISION MAKING Described in Section 5.2.2.4. Decision-making techniques that can be used in the Acquire Resources process include  but are not limited to multicriteria decision analysis, as described in Section 8.1.2.4. Selection criteria are often used to  select physical project resources, or the project team. Using a multicriteria decision analysis tool, criteria are developed  and used to rate or score potential resources (for example, choosing between internal and external team resources). The  criteria are weighted according to their relative importance and values can be changed for different types of resources.  Some examples of selection criteria that can be used are: u u Availability. Verify that the resource is available to work on the project within the time period needed. u u Cost. Verify if the cost of adding the resource is within the prescribed budget. u u Ability. Verify that the team member provides the capability needed by the project. Some selection criteria that are unique for team resources are: u u Experience. Verify that the team member has the relevant experience that will contribute to the project success. u u Knowledge. Consider if the team member has relevant knowledge of the customer, similar implemented projects,  and nuances of the project environment. u u Skills. Determine if the team member has the relevant skills to use a project tool. u u Attitude. Determine if the team member has the ability to work with others as a cohesive team. u u International factors. Consider team member location, time zone, and communication capabilities. 9.3.2.2 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS An interpersonal and team skill that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to negotiation. Described  in Section 12.2.2.5. Many projects need to negotiate for required resources. The project management team may need  to negotiate with: u u Functional managers. Ensure that the project receives the best resources possible in the required timeframe  and until their responsibilities are complete. u u Other project management teams within the performing organization. Appropriately assign or share scarce  or specialized resources. u u External organizations and suppliers. Provide appropriate, scarce, specialized, qualiﬁed, certiﬁed, or other  speciﬁc team or physical resources. Special consideration should be given to external negotiating policies,  practices, processes, guidelines, legal, and other such criteria. 333 The project management team’s ability to inﬂuence others plays an important role in negotiating resource allocation,  as does the politics of the organizations involved. For example, convincing a functional manager about the high visibility  of the project may inﬂuence him or her to assign the best resources to this project over competing ones. 9.3.2.3 PRE-ASSIGNMENT When physical or team resources for a project are determined in advance, they are considered pre-assigned. This  situation can occur if the project is the result of speciﬁc resources being identiﬁed as part of a competitive proposal or if  the project is dependent upon the expertise of particular persons. Pre-assignment might also include the team members  who have already been assigned in Develop Project Charter Process or other processes before the initial Resource  Management Plan has been completed. 9.3.2.4 VIRTUAL TEAMS The use of virtual teams creates new possibilities when acquiring project team members. Virtual teams can be  deﬁned as groups of people with a shared goal who fulﬁll their roles with little or no time spent meeting face to face. The  availability of communication technology such as email, audio conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and  video conferencing has made virtual teams feasible. The virtual team model makes it possible to: u u Form teams of people from the same organization who live in widespread geographic areas; u u Add special expertise to a project team even though the expert is not in the same geographic area; u u Incorporate employees who work from home ofﬁces; u u Form teams of people who work different shifts, hours, or days; u u Include people with mobility limitations or disabilities;  u u Move forward with projects that would have been held or canceled due to travel expenses; and u u Save the expense of ofﬁces and all physical equipment needed for employees.

11.1.3 PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS,16850,"11.1.3.1 RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN The risk management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how risk management  activities will be structured and performed. The risk management plan may include some or all of the following elements: u u Risk strategy. Describes the general approach to managing risk on this project. u u Methodology. Deﬁnes the speciﬁc approaches, tools, and data sources that will be used to perform risk  management on the project. u u Roles and responsibilities. Deﬁnes the lead, support, and risk management team members for each type of  activity described in the risk management plan, and clariﬁes their responsibilities. u u Funding. Identiﬁes the funds needed to perform activities related to Project Risk Management. Establishes  protocols for the application of contingency and management reserves. u u Timing. Deﬁnes when and how often the Project Risk Management processes will be performed throughout the  project life cycle, and establishes risk management activities for inclusion into the project schedule. u u Risk categories. Provide a means for grouping individual project risks. A common way to structure risk categories  is with a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk (see  example in Figure 11-4). An RBS helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual  project risks may arise. This can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identiﬁed risks. The  organization may have a generic RBS to be used for all projects, or there may be several RBS frameworks for  different types of projects, or the project may develop a tailored RBS. Where an RBS is not used, an organization  may use a custom risk categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a  structure based on project objectives. 406    Part 1 - Guide RBS LEVEL 0 0.

Figure 11-4. Extract from Sample Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) 407 u u Stakeholder risk appetite. The risk appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk  management plan, as they inform the details of the Plan Risk Management process. In particular, stakeholder risk  appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective. These thresholds will  determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the deﬁnitions of  probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks. u u Definitions of risk probability and impacts. Deﬁnitions of risk probability and impact levels are speciﬁc to the  project context and reﬂect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders. The project  may generate speciﬁc deﬁnitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general deﬁnitions provided  by the organization. The number of levels reﬂects the degree of detail required for the Project Risk Management  process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically ﬁve levels), and fewer for a simple  process (usually three). Table 11-1 provides an example of deﬁnitions of probability and impacts against three  project objectives. These scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact  deﬁnitions as negative for threats (delay, additional cost, and performance shortfall) and positive for opportunities  (reduced time or cost, and performance enhancement).

Described in Section 11.3.2.6. Prioritization rules may be speciﬁed by the  organization in advance of the project and be included in organizational process assets, or they may be tailored to  the speciﬁc project. Opportunities and threats are represented in a common probability and impact matrix using  positive deﬁnitions of impact for opportunities and negative impact deﬁnitions for threats. Descriptive terms  (such as very high, high, medium, low, and very low) or numeric values can be used for probability and impact.  Where numeric values are used, these can be multiplied to give a probability-impact score for each risk, which  allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level. An example probability and  impact matrix is presented in Figure 11-5, which also shows a possible numeric risk scoring scheme. Figure 11-5.

11.2.2 IDENTIFY RISKS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES,17320,"11.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  of similar projects or business areas. Such experts should be identiﬁed by the project manager and invited to consider  all aspects of individual project risks as well as sources of overall project risk, based on their previous experience and  areas of expertise. The experts’ bias should be taken into account in this process. 11.2.2.2 DATA GATHERING Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: u u Brainstorming. The goal of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2) is to obtain a comprehensive list of individual  project risks and sources of overall project risk. The project team usually performs brainstorming, often with  a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team. Ideas are generated under the guidance of a  facilitator, either in a free-form brainstorm session or one that uses more structured techniques. Categories of  risk, such as in a risk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. Particular attention should be paid to  ensuring that risks identiﬁed through brainstorming are clearly described, since the technique can result in ideas  that are not fully formed. u u Checklists. A checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. It is often used as a reminder.  Risk checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been accumulated from  similar projects and from other sources of information. They are an effective way to capture lessons learned  from similar completed projects, listing speciﬁc individual project risks that have occurred previously and that  may be relevant to this project. The organization may maintain a risk checklist based on its own completed  projects or may use generic risk checklists from the industry. While a checklist may be quick and simple to use,  it is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid  the effort of proper risk identiﬁcation. The project team should also explore items that do not appear on the  checklist. Additionally, the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as  remove or archive obsolete information. u u Interviews. Individual project risks and sources of overall project risk can be identiﬁed by interviewing experienced  project participants, stakeholders, and subject matter experts. Interviews (see Section 5.2.2.2) should be  conducted in an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality to encourage honest and unbiased contributions. 415 11.2.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: u u Root cause analysis. Root cause analysis (see Section 8.2.2.2) is typically used to discover the underlying  causes that lead to a problem, and develop preventive action. It can be used to identify threats by starting with a  problem statement (for example, the project might be delayed or over budget) and exploring which threats might  result in that problem occurring. The same technique can be used to ﬁnd opportunities by starting with a beneﬁt  statement (for example, early delivery or under budget) and exploring which opportunities might result in that  beneﬁt being realized. u u Assumption and constraint analysis. Every project and its project management plan are conceived  and developed based on a set of assumptions and within a series of constraints. These are often already  incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. Assumption and constraint analysis explores the  validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the project. Threats may be identiﬁed  from the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions. Constraints may give rise to  opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project or process. u u SWOT analysis. This technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,  and threats (SWOT) perspectives. For risk identiﬁcation, it is used to increase the breadth of identiﬁed risks by  including internally generated risks. The technique starts with the identiﬁcation of strengths and weaknesses  of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general. SWOT analysis  then identiﬁes any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting from  weaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may offset threats and  determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities. u u Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Risks may be identiﬁed from a structured review of project  documents, including, but not limited to, plans, assumptions, constraints, previous project ﬁles, contracts,  agreements, and technical documentation. Uncertainty or ambiguity in project documents, as well as  inconsistencies within a document or between different documents, may be indicators of risk on the project. 416    Part 1 - Guide 11.2.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation (see Section  4.1.2.3). Facilitation improves the effectiveness of many of the techniques used to identify individual project risks and  sources of overall project risk. A skilled facilitator can help participants remain focused on the risk identiﬁcation task,  follow the method associated with the technique accurately, ensure clear risk descriptions, identify and overcome  sources of bias, and resolve any disagreements that may arise. 11.2.2.5 PROMPT LISTS A prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also  act as sources of overall project risk. The prompt list can be used as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation  when using risk identiﬁcation techniques. The risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be  used as a prompt list for individual project risks. Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying  sources of overall project risk, for example PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental), TECOP  (technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political), or VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity). 11.2.2.6 MEETINGS To undertake risk identiﬁcation, the project team may conduct a specialized meeting (often called a risk workshop).  Most risk workshops include some form of brainstorming (see Section 4.1.2.2), but other risk identiﬁcation techniques  may be included depending on the level of the risk process deﬁned in the risk management plan. Use of a skilled  facilitator will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. It is also essential to ensure that the right people participate in  the risk workshop. On larger projects, it may be appropriate to invite the project sponsor, subject matter experts, sellers,  representatives of the customer, or other project stakeholders. Risk workshops for smaller projects may be restricted to  a subset of the project team. ","11.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT Described in Section 4.1.2.1.

11.3.2 PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES,17586,"11.3.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  or training in the following topics: u u Previous similar projects, and u u Qualitative risk analysis. Expert judgment is often obtained through facilitated risk workshops or interviews. The possibility of expert views  being biased should be taken into account in this process. 11.3.2.2 DATA GATHERING Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to interviews. Structured or  semi-structured interviews (Section 5.2.2.2) can be used to assess the probability and impacts of individual project risks,  as well as other factors. The interviewer should promote an environment of trust and conﬁdentiality in the interview  setting to encourage honest and unbiased assessments. 423 11.3.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to: u u Risk data quality assessment. Risk data quality assessment evaluates the degree to which the data about  individual project risks is accurate and reliable as a basis for qualitative risk analysis. The use of low-quality  risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis that is of little use to the project. If data quality is unacceptable,  it may be necessary to gather better data. Risk data quality may be assessed via a questionnaire measuring  the project’s stakeholder perceptions of various characteristics, which may include completeness, objectivity,  relevancy, and timeliness. A weighted average of selected data quality characteristics can then be generated to  give an overall quality score. u u Risk probability and impact assessment. Risk probability assessment considers the likelihood that a speciﬁc  risk will occur. Risk impact assessment considers the potential effect on one or more project objectives such  as schedule, cost, quality, or performance. Impacts will be negative for threats and positive for opportunities.  Probability and impact are assessed for each identiﬁed individual project risk. Risks can be assessed in  interviews or meetings with participants selected for their familiarity with the types of risk recorded in the  risk register. Project team members and knowledgeable persons external to the project are included. The level  of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective are evaluated during the interview or meeting.  Differences in the levels of probability and impact perceived by stakeholders are to be expected, and such  differences should be explored. Explanatory detail, including assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are  also recorded. Risk probabilities and impacts are assessed using the deﬁnitions given in the risk management  plan (see Table 11-1). Risks with low probability and impact may be included within the risk register as part  of a watch list for future monitoring. u u Assessment of other risk parameters. The project team may consider other characteristics of risk (in addition  to probability and impact) when prioritizing individual project risks for further analysis and action. These  characteristics may include but are not limited to: 424    Part 1 - Guide u n Urgency. The period of time within which a response to the risk is to be implemented in order to be effective.  A short period indicates high urgency. u n Proximity. The period of time before the risk might have an impact on one or more project objectives. A short  period indicates high proximity. u n Dormancy. The period of time that may elapse after a risk has occurred before its impact is discovered. A  short period indicates low dormancy. u n Manageability. The ease with which the risk owner (or owning organization) can manage the occurrence or  impact of a risk. Where management is easy, manageability is high. u n Controllability. The degree to which the risk owner (or owning organization) is able to control the risk’s  outcome. Where the outcome can be easily controlled, controllability is high. u n Detectability. The ease with which the results of the risk occurring, or being about to occur, can be detected  and recognized. Where the risk occurrence can be detected easily, detectability is high. u n Connectivity. The extent to which the risk is related to other individual project risks. Where a risk is connected  to many other risks, connectivity is high. u n Strategic impact. The potential for the risk to have a positive or negative effect on the organization’s strategic  goals. Where the risk has a major effect on strategic goals, strategic impact is high. u n Propinquity. The degree to which a risk is perceived to matter by one or more stakeholders. Where a risk is  perceived as very signiﬁcant, propinquity is high. The consideration of some of these characteristics can provide a more robust prioritization of risks than is possible  by only assessing probability and impact. 11.3.2.4 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process include but are not limited to facilitation (see Section  4.1.2.3). Facilitation improves the effectiveness of the qualitative analysis of individual project risks. A skilled facilitator  can help participants remain focused on the risk analysis task, follow the method associated with the technique  accurately, reach consensus on assessments of probability and impacts, identify and overcome sources of bias, and  resolve any disagreements that may arise. 425 11.3.2.5 RISK CATEGORIZATION Risks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk (e.g., using the risk breakdown structure (RBS); see  Figure 11-4), the area of the project affected (e.g., using the work breakdown structure (WBS); see Figures 5-12,  5-13, and 5-14), or other useful categories (e.g., project phase, project budget, and roles and responsibilities) to  determine the areas of the project most exposed to the effects of uncertainty. Risks can also be categorized by  common root causes. Risk categories that may be used for the project are deﬁned in the risk management plan. Grouping risks into categories can lead to the development of more effective risk responses by focusing attention and  effort on the areas of highest risk exposure, or by developing generic risk responses to address groups of related risks. 11.3.2.6 DATA REPRESENTATION Data representation techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to: u u Probability and impact matrix. A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability of each  risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. This matrix speciﬁes combinations of  probability and impact that allow individual project risks to be divided into priority groups (see Figure 11-5). Risks  can be prioritized for further analysis and planning of risk responses based on their probability and impacts.  The probability of occurrence for each individual project risk is assessed as well as its impact on one or more  project objectives if it does occur, using deﬁnitions of probability and impact for the project as speciﬁed in the  risk management plan. Individual project risks are assigned to a priority level based on the combination of their  assessed probability and impact, using a probability and impact matrix. An organization can assess a risk separately for each objective (e.g., cost, time, and scope) by having a separate  probability and impact matrix for each. Alternatively, it may develop ways to determine one overall priority level  for each risk, either by combining assessments for different objectives, or by taking the highest priority level  regardless of which objective is affected. u u Hierarchical charts. Where risks have been categorized using more than two parameters, the probability and  impact matrix cannot be used and other graphical representations are required. For example, a bubble chart displays  three dimensions of data, where each risk is plotted as a disk (bubble), and the three parameters are represented  by the x-axis value, the y-axis value, and the bubble size. An example bubble chart is shown in Figure 11-10, with  detectability and proximity plotted on the x and y axes, and impact value represented by bubble size.

Facilitated workshops can improve effectiveness by establishing a  clear understanding of the purpose of the workshop, building consensus among participants, ensuring continued  focus on the task, and using creative approaches to deal with interpersonal conﬂict or sources of bias. 11.4.2.4 REPRESENTATIONS OF UNCERTAINTY Quantitative risk analysis requires inputs to a quantitative risk analysis model that reﬂect individual project risks and  other sources of uncertainty. Where the duration, cost, or resource requirement for a planned activity is uncertain, the range of possible values  can be represented in the model as a probability distribution. This may take several forms. The most commonly used  are triangular, normal, lognormal, beta, uniform, or discrete distributions. Care should be taken when selecting an  appropriate probability distribution to reﬂect the range of possible values for the planned activity. Individual project risks may be covered by probability distributions. Alternatively, risks may be included in the  model as probabilistic branches, where optional activities are added to the model to represent the time and/or cost  impact of the risk should it occur, and the chance that these activities actually occur in a particular simulation run  matches the risk’s probability. Branches are most useful for risks that might occur independently of any planned  activity. Where risks are related, for example, with a common cause or a logical dependency, correlation is used in  the model to indicate this relationship. Other sources of uncertainty may also be represented using branches to describe alternative paths through  the project. 433 11.4.2.5 DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis techniques that can be used during this process include but are not limited to: u u Simulation. Quantitative risk analysis uses a model that simulates the combined effects of individual project risks  and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. Simulations  are typically performed using a Monte Carlo analysis. When running a Monte Carlo analysis for cost risk, the  simulation uses the project cost estimates. When running a Monte Carlo analysis for schedule risk, the schedule  network diagram and duration estimates are used. An integrated quantitative cost-schedule risk analysis uses  both inputs. The output is a quantitative risk analysis model. Computer software is used to iterate the quantitative risk analysis model several thousand times. The input  values (e.g., cost estimates, duration estimates, or occurrence of probabilistic branches) are chosen at random  for each iteration. Outputs represent the range of possible outcomes for the project (e.g., project end date,  project cost at completion). Typical outputs include a histogram presenting the number of iterations where a  particular outcome resulted from the simulation, or a cumulative probability distribution (S-curve) representing  the probability of achieving any particular outcome or less. An example S-curve from a Monte Carlo cost risk  analysis is shown in Figure 11-13. Figure 11-13.

A criticality index is calculated for  each element in the risk model, which gives the frequency with which that element appears on the critical path  during the simulation, usually expressed as a percentage. The output from a criticality analysis allows the project  team to focus risk response planning efforts on those activities with the highest potential effect on the overall  schedule performance of the project. u u Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of  uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. It correlates variations in project outcomes with  variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model. One typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram, which presents the calculated correlation  coefﬁcient for each element of the quantitative risk analysis model that can inﬂuence the project outcome.  This can include individual project risks, project activities with high degrees of variability, or speciﬁc sources  of ambiguity. Items are ordered by descending strength of correlation, giving the typical tornado appearance.   An example tornado diagram is shown in Figure 11-14. Figure 11-14.

11.5.2 PLAN RISK RESPONSES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES,18376,"11.5.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  in the following topics: u u Threat response strategies, u u Opportunity response strategies, u u Contingent response strategies, and u u Overall project risk response strategies. Expert input may be sought from individuals with particular subject matter expertise relevant to a speciﬁc individual  project risk, for example, where specialist technical knowledge is required. 442    Part 1 - Guide 11.5.2.2 DATA GATHERING Data-gathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to interviews (see  Section 5.2.2.2). Development of responses to individual project risks and overall project risk may be undertaken  during structured or semi-structured interviews (see Section 5.2.2.2) with risk owners. Other stakeholders may  also be interviewed if necessary. The interviewer should promote an environment of trust and confidentiality in the  interview setting to encourage honest and unbiased decisions. 11.5.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation (see  Section 4.1.2.3). The use of facilitation improves the effectiveness of developing responses to individual project  risks and overall project risk. A skilled facilitator can help risk owners understand the risk, identify and compare  alternative possible risk response strategies, choose an appropriate response strategy, and identify and overcome  sources of bias. 11.5.2.4 STRATEGIES FOR THREATS Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with threats, as follows: u u Escalate. Escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that a threat is outside  the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager’s authority. Escalated  risks are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, and not on the  project level. The project manager determines who should be notiﬁed about the threat and communicates the  details to that person or part of the organization. It is important that ownership of escalated threats is accepted  by the relevant party in the organization. Threats are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives  that would be affected if the threat occurred. Escalated threats are not monitored further by the project team after  escalation, although they may be recorded in the risk register for information. 443 u u Avoid. Risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its  impact. It may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative  impact. Avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective  that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. The  risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risk’s impact if it were to occur.  Examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat, extending the schedule, changing the  project strategy, or reducing scope. Some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information,  improving communication, or acquiring expertise. u u Transfer. Transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the  impact if the threat occurs. Risk transfer often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the  threat. Transfer can be achieved by a range of actions, which include but are not limited to the use of insurance,  performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. Agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for  speciﬁed risks to another party. u u Mitigate. In risk mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat. Early  mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting  less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation  actions. Mitigation may involve prototype development (see Section 5.2.2.8) to reduce the risk of scaling up from  a bench-scale model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response  might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity. For example, designing redundancy into a  system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component. u u Accept. Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is taken. This strategy  may be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective  to address a threat in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active  acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to  handle the threat if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the  threat to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly. 444  Part 1 - Guide 11.5.2.5 STRATEGIES FOR OPPORTUNITIES Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities, as follows: u u Escalate. This risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that  an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project  manager’s authority. Escalated opportunities are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant  part of the organization, and not on the project level. The project manager determines who should be notiﬁed  about the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. It is important  that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. Opportunities  are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred.  Escalated opportunities are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although they may be  recorded in the risk register for information. u u Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the organization wants to  ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to capture the beneﬁt associated with a particular  opportunity by ensuring that it deﬁnitely happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. Examples of  exploiting responses may include assigning an organization’s most talented resources to the project to reduce  the time to completion, or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration. u u Share. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it shares some of the  beneﬁt if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they  are best able to capture the opportunity for the beneﬁt of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a  risk premium to the party taking on the opportunity. Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing  partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures. u u Enhance. The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or impact of an opportunity. Early  enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the beneﬁt after the opportunity has occurred.  The probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it  is not possible to increase probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors  that drive the size of the potential beneﬁt. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources  to an activity to ﬁnish early. u u Accept. Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may  be appropriate for low-priority opportunities, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective  to address an opportunity in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active  acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to take  advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic  review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly. 445 11.5.2.6 CONTINGENT RESPONSE STRATEGIES Some responses are designed for use only if certain events occur. For some risks, it is appropriate for the project  team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predeﬁned conditions, if it is believed that  there will be sufﬁcient warning to implement the plan. Events that trigger the contingency response, such as missing  intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a seller, should be deﬁned and tracked. Risk responses  identiﬁed using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans and include identiﬁed triggering  events that set the plans in effect. 11.5.2.7 STRATEGIES FOR OVERALL PROJECT RISK Risk responses should be planned and implemented not only for individual project risks but also to address overall  project risk. The same risk response strategies that are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to  overall project risk: u u Avoid. Where the level of overall project risk is signiﬁcantly negative and outside the agreed-upon risk  thresholds for the project, an avoid strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to reduce  the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and bring the project back within the thresholds.  An example of avoidance at the overall project level would include removal of high-risk elements of scope  from the project. Where it is not possible to bring the project back within the thresholds, the project may be  canceled. This represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the overall  level of threat is, and will remain, unacceptable. u u Exploit. Where the level of overall project risk is signiﬁcantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds  for the project, an exploit strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to capture the positive  effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. An example of exploiting at the overall project level would include  addition of high-beneﬁt elements of scope to the project to add value or beneﬁts to stakeholders. Alternatively  the risk thresholds for the project may be modiﬁed with the agreement of key stakeholders in order to embrace  the opportunity. u u Transfer/share. If the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable to address it effectively,  a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the organization. Where overall project risk is  negative, a transfer strategy is required, which may involve payment of a risk premium. In the case of high  positive overall project risk, ownership may be shared in order to reap the associated beneﬁts. Examples of  both transfer and share strategies for overall project risk include but are not limited to setting up a collaborative  business structure in which the buyer and the seller share the overall project risk, launching a joint venture or  special-purpose company, or subcontracting key elements of the project. 446  Part 1 - Guide u u Mitigate/enhance. These strategies involve changing the level of overall project risk to optimize the chances  of achieving the project’s objectives. The mitigation strategy is used where overall project risk is negative, and  enhancement applies when it is positive. Examples of mitigation or enhancement strategies include replanning  the project, changing the scope and boundaries of the project, modifying project priority, changing resource  allocations, adjusting delivery times, etc. u u Accept. Where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project risk, the organization  may choose to continue with the project as currently deﬁned, even if overall project risk is outside the agreed- upon thresholds. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is  to establish an overall contingency reserve for the project, including amounts of time, money, or resources to be  used if the project exceeds its thresholds. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic  review of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it does not change signiﬁcantly. 11.5.2.8 DATA ANALYSIS A number of alternative risk response strategies may be considered. Data analysis techniques that can be used to  select a preferred risk response strategy include but are not limited to: u u Alternatives analysis. A simple comparison of the characteristics and requirements of alternative risk response  options can lead to a decision on which response is most appropriate. u u Cost-benefit analysis. If the impact of an individual project risk can be quantiﬁed in monetary terms, then the  cost-effectiveness of alternative risk response strategies can be determined using cost-beneﬁt analysis (see  Section 8.1.2.3). The ratio of (change in impact level) divided by (implementation cost) gives the cost effectiveness  of the response strategy, with a higher ratio indicating a more effective response. 11.5.2.9 DECISION MAKING Decision-making techniques that can be used to select a risk response strategy include but are not limited to  multicriteria decision analysis (described in Section 8.1.2.4). One or more risk response strategies may be under  consideration. Decision-making techniques can help prioritize risk response strategies. Multicriteria decision analysis  uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic approach for establishing key decision criteria, evaluating and ranking  alternatives, and selecting a preferred option. Criteria for risk response selection may include but are not limited to  cost of response, likely effectiveness of response in changing probability and/or impact, resource availability, timing  constraints (urgency, proximity, and dormancy), level of impact if the risk occurs, effect of response on related risks,  introduction of secondary risks, etc. Different strategies may be selected later in the project if the original choice proves  to be ineffective. ","11.5.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT Described in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledge  in the following topics: u u Threat response strategies, u u Opportunity response strategies, u u Contingent response strategies, and u u Overall project risk response strategies. Expert input may be sought from individuals with particular subject matter expertise relevant to a specic individual  project risk, for example, where specialist technical knowledge is required. 442    Part 1  Guide 11.5.2.2 DATA GATHERING Datagathering techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to interviews . Development of responses to individual project risks and overall project risk may be undertaken  during structured or semistructured interviews  with risk owners. Other stakeholders may  also be interviewed if necessary. The interviewer should promote an environment of trust and confidentiality in the  interview setting to encourage honest and unbiased decisions. 11.5.2.3 INTERPERSONAL AND TEAM SKILLS Interpersonal and team skills that can be used for this process includes but are not limited to facilitation . The use of facilitation improves the effectiveness of developing responses to individual project  risks and overall project risk. A skilled facilitator can help risk owners understand the risk, identify and compare  alternative possible risk response strategies, choose an appropriate response strategy, and identify and overcome  sources of bias. 11.5.2.4 STRATEGIES FOR THREATS Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with threats, as follows: u u Escalate. Escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that a threat is outside  the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project managers authority. Escalated  risks are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant part of the organization, and not on the  project level. The project manager determines who should be notied about the threat and communicates the  details to that person or part of the organization. It is important that ownership of escalated threats is accepted  by the relevant party in the organization. Threats are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives  that would be affected if the threat occurred. Escalated threats are not monitored further by the project team after  escalation, although they may be recorded in the risk register for information. 443 u u Avoid. Risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its  impact. It may be appropriate for highpriority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative  impact. Avoidance may involve changing some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective  that is in jeopardy in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. The  risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risks impact if it were to occur.  Examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat, extending the schedule, changing the  project strategy, or reducing scope. Some risks can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information,  improving communication, or acquiring expertise. u u Transfer. Transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the  impact if the threat occurs. Risk transfer often involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the  threat. Transfer can be achieved by a range of actions, which include but are not limited to the use of insurance,  performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. Agreements may be used to transfer ownership and liability for  specied risks to another party. u u Mitigate. In risk mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence andor impact of a threat. Early  mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting  less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation  actions. Mitigation may involve prototype development  to reduce the risk of scaling up from  a benchscale model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response  might reduce the impact by targeting factors that drive the severity. For example, designing redundancy into a  system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component. u u Accept. Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is taken. This strategy  may be appropriate for lowpriority threats, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or costeffective  to address a threat in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active  acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to  handle the threat if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of the  threat to ensure that it does not change signicantly. 444  Part 1  Guide 11.5.2.5 STRATEGIES FOR OPPORTUNITIES Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities, as follows: u u Escalate. This risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that  an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project  managers authority. Escalated opportunities are managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant  part of the organization, and not on the project level. The project manager determines who should be notied  about the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. It is important  that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. Opportunities  are usually escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred.  Escalated opportunities are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although they may be  recorded in the risk register for information. u u Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for highpriority opportunities where the organization wants to  ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to capture the benet associated with a particular  opportunity by ensuring that it denitely happens, increasing the probability of occurrence to 100. Examples of  exploiting responses may include assigning an organizations most talented resources to the project to reduce  the time to completion, or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration. u u Share. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that it shares some of the  benet if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new owner of a shared opportunity carefully so they  are best able to capture the opportunity for the benet of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a  risk premium to the party taking on the opportunity. Examples of sharing actions include forming risksharing  partnerships, teams, specialpurpose companies, or joint ventures. u u Enhance. The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability andor impact of an opportunity. Early  enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the benet after the opportunity has occurred.  The probability of occurrence of an opportunity may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it  is not possible to increase probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors  that drive the size of the potential benet. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources  to an activity to nish early. u u Accept. Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is taken. This strategy may  be appropriate for lowpriority opportunities, and it may also be adopted where it is not possible or costeffective  to address an opportunity in any other way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active  acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to take  advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic  review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not change signicantly. 445 11.5.2.6 CONTINGENT RESPONSE STRATEGIES Some responses are designed for use only if certain events occur. For some risks, it is appropriate for the project  team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predened conditions, if it is believed that  there will be sufcient warning to implement the plan. Events that trigger the contingency response, such as missing  intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a seller, should be dened and tracked. Risk responses  identied using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans and include identied triggering  events that set the plans in effect. 11.5.2.7 STRATEGIES FOR OVERALL PROJECT RISK Risk responses should be planned and implemented not only for individual project risks but also to address overall  project risk. The same risk response strategies that are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to  overall project risk: u u Avoid. Where the level of overall project risk is signicantly negative and outside the agreedupon risk  thresholds for the project, an avoid strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to reduce  the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and bring the project back within the thresholds.  An example of avoidance at the overall project level would include removal of highrisk elements of scope  from the project. Where it is not possible to bring the project back within the thresholds, the project may be  canceled. This represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance and it should be used only if the overall  level of threat is, and will remain, unacceptable. u u Exploit. Where the level of overall project risk is signicantly positive and outside the agreedupon risk thresholds  for the project, an exploit strategy may be adopted. This involves taking focused action to capture the positive  effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. An example of exploiting at the overall project level would include  addition of highbenet elements of scope to the project to add value or benets to stakeholders. Alternatively  the risk thresholds for the project may be modied with the agreement of key stakeholders in order to embrace  the opportunity. u u Transfershare. If the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable to address it effectively,  a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the organization. Where overall project risk is  negative, a transfer strategy is required, which may involve payment of a risk premium.

Market  research includes examination of industry and speciﬁc seller capabilities. Procurement teams may leverage information  gained at conferences, online reviews, and a variety of sources to identify market capabilities. The team may also reﬁne  speciﬁc procurement objectives to leverage maturing technologies while balancing risks associated with the breadth of  sellers who can provide the desired materials or services. 12.1.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to make-or-buy analysis.   A make-or-buy analysis is used to determine whether work or deliverables can best be accomplished by the project  team or should be purchased from outside sources. Factors to consider in the make-or-buy decision include the  organization’s current resource allocation and their skills and abilities, the need for specialized expertise, the desire to  not expand permanent employment obligations, and the need for independent expertise. It also includes evaluating the  risks involved with each make-or-buy decision. Make-or-buy analysis may use payback period, return on investment (ROI), internal rate of return (IRR), discounted  cash ﬂow, net present value (NPV), beneﬁt/cost analysis (BCA), or other techniques in order to decide whether to include  something as part of the project or purchase it externally. 12.1.2.4 SOURCE SELECTION ANALYSIS It is necessary to review the prioritization of the competing demands for the project before deciding on the selection  method. Since competitive selection methods may require sellers to invest a large amount of time and resources  upfront, it is a good practice to include the evaluation method in the procurement documents so bidders know how they  will be evaluated. Commonly used selection methods include the following: u u Least cost. The least cost method may be appropriate for procurements of a standard or routine nature where  well-established practices and standards exist and from which a speciﬁc and well-deﬁned outcome is expected,  which can be executed at different costs. u u Qualifications only. The qualiﬁcations only selection method applies when the time and cost of a full selection  process would not make sense because the value of the procurement is relatively small.

Because sellers are subject to a cost  constraint, they will adapt the scope and quality of their offer to that budget. The buyer should therefore ensure  that the budget is compatible with the SOW and that the seller will be able to perform the tasks within the budget.  This method is appropriate only when the SOW is precisely deﬁned, no changes are anticipated, and the budget  is ﬁxed and cannot be exceeded. 12.1.2.5 MEETINGS Research alone may not provide speciﬁc information to formulate a procurement strategy without additional  information interchange meetings with potential bidders.

A general data-gathering and creativity technique that elicits input from groups such as team  members or subject matter experts. u n Brain writing. A reﬁnement of brainstorming that allows individual participants time to consider the question(s)  individually before the group creativity session is held. The information can be gathered in face-to-face  groups or using virtual environments supported by technology. 512    Part 1 - Guide 13.1.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS Data analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: u u Stakeholder analysis. Stakeholder analysis results in a list of stakeholders and relevant information such as  their positions in the organization, roles on the project, “stakes,” expectations, attitudes (their levels of support  for the project), and their interest in information about the project. Stakeholders’ stakes can include but are not  limited to a combination of: u n Interest. A person or group can be affected by a decision related to the project or its outcomes. u n Rights (legal or moral rights). Legal rights, such as occupational health and safety, may be deﬁned in the  legislation framework of a country. Moral rights may involve concepts of protection of historical sites or  environmental sustainability. u n Ownership. A person or group has a legal title to an asset or a property. u n Knowledge. Specialist knowledge, which can beneﬁt the project through more effective delivery of project  objectives, organizational outcomes, or knowledge of the power structures of the organization. u n Contribution. Provision of funds or other resources, including human resources, or providing support for the  project in more intangible ways, such as advocacy in the form of promoting the objectives of the project or  acting as a buffer between the project and the power structures of the organization and its politics. u u Document analysis. Described in Section 5.2.2.3. Assessing the available project documentation and lessons  learned from previous projects to identify stakeholders and other supporting information. 13.1.2.4 DATA REPRESENTATION A data representation technique that may be used in this process includes but is not limited to stakeholder mapping/ representation. Stakeholder mapping and representation is a method of categorizing stakeholders using various  methods. Categorizing stakeholders assists the team in building relationships with the identiﬁed project stakeholders.  Common methods include: u u Power/interest grid, power/influence grid, or impact/influence grid. Each of these techniques supports  a grouping of stakeholders according to their level of authority (power), level of concern about the project’s  outcomes (interest), ability to inﬂuence the outcomes of the project (inﬂuence), or ability to cause changes to  the project’s planning or execution. These classiﬁcation models are useful for small projects or for projects with  simple relationships between stakeholders and the project, or within the stakeholder community itself. 513 u u Stakeholder cube. This is a reﬁnement of the grid models previously mentioned. This model combines the  grid elements into a three-dimensional model that can be useful to project managers and teams in identifying  and engaging their stakeholder community. It provides a model with multiple dimensions that improves the  depiction of the stakeholder community as a multidimensional entity and assists with the development of  communication strategies. u u Salience model. Describes classes of stakeholders based on assessments of their power (level of authority or  ability to inﬂuence the outcomes of the project), urgency (need for immediate attention, either time-constrained  or relating to the stakeholders’ high stake in the outcome), and legitimacy (their involvement is appropriate).  There is an adaptation of the salience model that substitutes proximity for legitimacy (applying to the team and  measuring their level of involvement with the work of the project). The salience model is useful for large complex  communities of stakeholders or where there are complex networks of relationships within the community.

1.1 PROJECTS AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT,21,"A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. The temporary nature of  projects indicates a deﬁnite beginning and end. Temporary does not necessarily mean a project has a short duration.  A project’s end is reached when the objectives have been achieved or when the project is terminated because its  objectives will not or cannot be met, or when the need for the project no longer exists. The decision to terminate a project  requires approval and authorization by an appropriate authority. Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project  requirements. Project management is accomplished through the appropriate application and integration of the project  management processes identiﬁed for the project. Managing a project typically includes but is not limited to: u u Identifying project requirements; u u Addressing the various needs, concerns, and expectations of stakeholders; u u Establishing and maintaining active communication with stakeholders; u u Managing resources; and u u Balancing the competing project constraints, which include but are not limited to: u n Scope, u n Schedule, u n Cost, u n Quality, u n Resources, and u n Risk. Project circumstances will inﬂuence how each project management process is implemented and how the project  constraints are prioritized.

"1.2 RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PORTFOLIOS, PROGRAMS, AND PROJECTS",56,"A portfolio is deﬁned as projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed in a coordinated manner  to achieve strategic objectives. Portfolio management is the centralized management of one or more portfolios to  achieve strategic objectives. Portfolio management focuses on ensuring the portfolio is performing consistent with the  organization’s objectives and evaluating portfolio components to optimize resource allocation. Portfolios may include  work that is operational in nature. A program is deﬁned as related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in a coordinated  manner to obtain beneﬁts not available from managing them individually. Programs include program related work  outside the scope of the discrete projects in the program. Program management is the application of knowledge,  skills, and principles to a program to achieve the program objectives and to obtain beneﬁts and control not available  by managing related program components individually. Programs may also include work that is operational in nature. Program management supports organizational strategies by authorizing, changing, or terminating projects and  managing their interdependencies. Managing project interdependencies may include, among other actions, the following: u u Resolving resource constraints and/or conﬂicts that affect components within the program; u u Aligning with the organization’s strategies that impact and affect program goals and objectives u u Managing issues and employing change management within a shared governance structure; u u Addressing project and program risks that can impact one or more components; and u u Managing program beneﬁts realization by effectively analyzing, sequencing and monitoring component  interdependencies. A project may be managed in three separate scenarios: as a stand-alone project (outside a portfolio or program);  within a program; or within a portfolio. Project management has interactions with portfolio and program management  when a project is within a portfolio or program. 544    Part 2 - Standard Figure 1-1 illustrates a sample portfolio structure indicating relationships of the components, shared resources  and stakeholders. The portfolio components are grouped together in order to facilitate the effective governance and  management of that work and to achieve organizational strategies and priorities. Organizational and portfolio planning  impact the components by means of prioritization based on risk, funding, and other considerations. This allows  organizations to have an overall view of how the strategic goals are reﬂected in the portfolio; institute appropriate  portfolio, program, and project governance; and authorize human, ﬁnancial, or physical resources. These resources  will be allocated based on expected performance and beneﬁts. Figure 1-1 illustrates that organizational strategies  and priorities are linked and have relationships between portfolios and programs, between portfolios and projects, and  between programs and individual projects. These relationships are not always strictly hierarchical. Organizational project management (OPM) is a strategy execution framework utilizing portfolio, program, and project  management. It provides a framework that enables organizations to consistently and predictably deliver on organizational  strategy, producing better performance, better results, and a sustainable competitive advantage.

1.4 PROJECT SUCCESS AND BENEFITS MANAGEMENT,177,"Projects are initiated to realize business opportunities that are aligned with an organization’s strategic goals. Prior  to initiating a project, a business case is often developed to outline the project objectives, the required investment, and  ﬁnancial and qualitative criteria for project success. The business case provides the basis to measure success and  progress throughout the project life cycle by comparing the results with the objectives and the identiﬁed success criteria. Projects are typically initiated as a result of one or more of the following strategic considerations: u u Market demand, u u Strategic opportunity/business need, u u Social need, u u Environmental consideration, u u Customer request, u u Technological advancement, u u Legal or regulatory requirement, and u u Existing or forecasted problem. A beneﬁts management plan describes how and when the beneﬁts of the project will be delivered and how they will  be measured. The beneﬁts management plan may include the following: u u Target benefits. The expected tangible and intangible business value to be gained by the implementation of the  product, service, or result. u u Strategic alignment. How the project beneﬁts support and align with the business strategies of the organization. u u Timeframe for realizing benefits. Beneﬁts by phase: short term, long term, and ongoing. u u Benefits owner. The accountable person or group that monitors, records, and reports realized beneﬁts throughout  the timeframe established in the plan. u u Metrics. The direct and indirect measurements used to show the beneﬁts realized. u u Risks. Risks associated with achieving target beneﬁts. 547 The success of the project is measured against the project objectives and success criteria. In many cases, the success  of the product, service, or result is not known until sometime after the project is complete. For example, an increase in  market share, a decrease in operating expenses, or the success of a new product may not be known when the project is  transitioned to operations. In these circumstances, the project management ofﬁce (PMO), portfolio steering committee,  or some other business function within the organization should evaluate the success at a later date to determine if the  outcomes met the business objectives. Both the business case and the beneﬁts management plan are developed prior to the project being initiated.  Additionally, both documents are referenced after the project has been completed. Therefore, they are considered  business documents rather than project documents or components of the project management plan.

1.5 THE PROJECT LIFE CYCLE,227,"A project life cycle is the series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion. A project  phase is a collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the completion of one or more deliverables.  The phases can be sequential, iterative, or overlapping. The names, number, and duration of the project phases are  determined by the management and control needs of the organization(s) involved in the project, the nature of the project  itself, and its area of application. Phases are time bound, with a start and end or control point (sometimes referred to  as a phase review, phase gate, control gate, or other similar term). At the control point, the project charter and business  documents are reexamined based on the current environment. At that time, the project’s performance is compared to  the project management plan to determine if the project should be changed, terminated, or continue as planned. 548    Part 2 - Standard The project life cycle can be inﬂuenced by the unique aspects of the organization, industry, development method, or  technology employed.

1.9 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCESS GROUPS,432,"This standard describes the project management processes employed to meet project objectives. Project management  processes are grouped in ﬁve Project Management Process Groups: u u Initiating Process Group. The process(es) performed to deﬁne a new project or a new phase of an existing  project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase. Initiating processes are described in Section 2. u u Planning Process Group. The process(es) required to establish the scope of the project, reﬁne the objectives,  and deﬁne the course of action required to attain the objectives that the project was undertaken to achieve.  Planning processes are described in Section 3. u u Executing Process Group. The process(es) performed to complete the work deﬁned in the project management  plan to satisfy the project requirements. Executing processes are described in Section 4. u u Monitoring and Controlling Process Group. The process(es) required to track, review, and regulate the progress  and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes to the plan are required; and initiate the  corresponding changes. Monitoring and Controlling processes are described in Section 5. u u Closing Process Group. The process(es) performed to formally complete or close a project, phase, or contract.  Closing processes are described in Section 6. These ﬁve Process Groups are independent of the application areas, (such as marketing, information services, or  accounting) or industry focus (such as construction, aerospace, telecommunications). Individual processes in the Process  Groups are often iterated prior to completing a phase or a project. The number of process iterations and interactions  between processes varies based on the needs of the project. Processes generally fall into one of three categories: u u Processes used once or at predefined points in the project. Developing the project charter and closing the  project or phase are examples. u u Processes that are performed periodically as needed. Acquiring resources is performed when resources are  needed. Conducting procurements will be performed prior to needing the procured item. u u Processes that are performed continuously throughout the project. Deﬁning activities may occur throughout  the project life cycle, especially when the project uses rolling wave planning or an adaptive development approach.  Many of the monitoring and control processes are ongoing from the start of the project, until it is closed out.

1.10 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND ORGANIZATIONAL,652,"PROCESS ASSETS Projects exist and operate in environments that may have an inﬂuence on them. These inﬂuences can have a favorable  or unfavorable impact on the project. Two major categories of inﬂuences are enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) and  organizational process assets (OPAs). EEFs originate from the environment outside of the project and often outside of the enterprise. These factors refer  to conditions, which are not under the control of the project team, that inﬂuence, constrain, or direct the project. EEFs  may have an impact at the enterprise, portfolio, program, or project level. (Refer to Section 2.2 in the PMBOK® Guide for  additional information on EEFs.) One set of such factors are the internal organizational culture, structure and governance.  Examples in this area include but are not limited to: vision, mission, values, beliefs, cultural norms, hierarchy, and  authority relationships. OPAs are internal to the enterprise. These may arise from the enterprise itself, a portfolio, a program, another project,  or a combination of these. OPAs are the plans, processes, policies, procedures, and knowledge bases speciﬁc to and  used by the performing organization. These assets inﬂuence the management of the project. Examples include but  are not limited to: change control procedures, templates, information from previous projects, and lessons learned  repositories. (Refer to Section 2.3 in the PMBOK® Guide for additional information on OPAs). ","PROCESS ASSETS Projects exist and operate in environments that may have an inuence on them.

1.11 TAILORING THE PROJECT ARTIFACTS,670,"The term artifact in this context includes project management processes, inputs, tools, techniques, outputs, EEFs, and  OPAs. The project manager and the project management team select and adapt the appropriate artifacts for use on their  speciﬁc project. This selection and adaptation activity is known as tailoring. Tailoring is necessary because each project  is unique; therefore, not every process, input, tool, technique, or output is required on every project. The project management plan is the most prevalent artifact. It has many components, such as the subsidiary  management plans, baselines, and a description of the project life cycle. Subsidiary management plans are plans  associated with a speciﬁc aspect or Knowledge Area of the project, for example, a schedule management plan,  risk management plan and change management plan. Part of tailoring is identifying the project management plan  components needed for a particular project. The project management plan is an input and project management plan  updates are an output of many processes in this standard. Rather than listing the individual project management plan  components in the input/output tables, examples of the components that may be inputs or may be updated as outputs  are listed beneath the input/output tables for each process. The possible components are listed as examples only. These  inputs and outputs are not required and are not the only inputs or updates to the project management plan that a project  manager may use in that particular process. The project management plan is one of the primary project artifacts, but there are other documents that are not  part of the project management plan that are used to manage the project. These other documents are called project  documents. Similar to project management plan components, project documents needed for a process will depend on  the individual project. The project manager is accountable for identifying the project documents needed for a process  and the project documents that will be updated as an output of a process. The project documents listed beneath the  input/output tables throughout this standard are possible examples of project documents, not a comprehensive list. Table 1-2 is a representative list of project management plan components and project documents. It is not complete  list, but it does provide a representation of the types of documents that are often used to help manage a project.

2.1 DEFINABLE WORK VS. HIGH-UNCERTAINTY WORK,10548,"Project work ranges from deﬁnable work to high-uncertainty work. Deﬁnable work projects are characterized by clear  procedures that have proved successful on similar projects in the past. The production of a car, electrical appliance, or  home after the design is complete are examples of deﬁnable work. The production domain and processes involved are  usually well understood and there are typically low levels of execution uncertainty and risk. New design, problem solving, and not-done-before work is exploratory. It requires subject matter experts to  collaborate and solve problems to create a solution. Examples of people encountering high-uncertainty work include  software systems engineers, product designers, doctors, teachers, lawyers, and many problem-solving engineers. As  more deﬁnable work is automated, project teams are undertaking more high-uncertainty work projects that require the  techniques described in this practice guide.

2.3 LEAN AND THE KANBAN METHOD,10660,"One way to think about the relationship between lean, agile, and the Kanban Method is to consider agile and the  Kanban Method as descendants of lean thinking. In other words, lean thinking is a superset, sharing attributes with  agile and Kanban. This shared heritage is very similar and focuses on delivering value, respect for people, minimizing waste, being  transparent, adapting to change, and continuously improving. Project teams sometimes ﬁnd it useful to blend various  methods—whatever works for the organization or team is what should be done regardless of its origin. The objective is  the best outcome regardless of the approach used. The Kanban Method is inspired by the original lean-manufacturing system and used speciﬁcally for knowledge work.  It emerged in the mid-2000s as an alternative to the agile methods that were prevalent at the time. 13 The Kanban Method is less prescriptive than some agile approaches and less disruptive, as it is the original “start- where-you-are” approach. Project teams can begin applying the Kanban Method with relative ease and progress toward  other agile approaches if that is what they deem necessary or appropriate. For more details on the Kanban Method, see  Annex A3 on Overview of Agile and Lean Frameworks.","One way to think about the relationship between lean, agile, and the Kanban Method is to consider agile and the  Kanban Method as descendants of lean thinking.

"2.4 UNCERTAINTY, RISK, AND LIFE CYCLE SELECTION",10675,"Some projects have considerable uncertainty around project requirements and how to fulﬁll those requirements using  current knowledge and technology. These uncertainties can contribute to high rates of change and project complexity.  These characteristics are illustrated in Figure 2-5. As project uncertainty increases, so too does the risk of rework and the need to use a different approach. To mitigate  the impact of these risks, teams select life cycles that allow them to tackle projects with high amounts of uncertainty  via small increments of work. Teams can verify their work when they use small increments and can change what they do next. When teams deliver  small increments, they are better able to understand the true customer requirements faster and more accurately than  with a static written speciﬁcation.

3.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF PROJECT LIFE CYCLES,10811,"Table 3-1 summarizes the characteristics of the four life cycle categories covered in this practice guide. Table 3-1. Characteristics of Four Categories of Life Cycles It is important to note that all projects have these characteristics—no project is completely devoid of considerations  around requirements, delivery, change, and goals. A project’s inherent characteristics determine which life cycle is the  best ﬁt for that project. Another way to understand how project life cycles vary is by using a continuum ranging from predictive cycles on one  end, to agile cycles on the other end, with more iterative or incremental cycles in the middle. Figure X3-1 of Appendix X3 of the PMBOK® Guide – Sixth Edition displays the continuum as a ﬂat line. This view  emphasizes the shifting of project characteristics from one end to the other. Another way to visualize the continuum is  with a two-dimensional square, as shown in Figure 3-1. Requirements Activities  Delivery Goal Approach Characteristics Predictive Iterative Incremental Agile Fixed Dynamic Dynamic Dynamic Performed once for  the entire project Repeated until  correct Performed once for  a given increment Repeated until  correct Single delivery Single delivery Frequent smaller  deliveries Frequent small  deliveries Manage cost Correctness of  solution Speed Customer value via  frequent deliveries  and feedback ","Table 31 summarizes the characteristics of the four life cycle categories covered in this practice guide.

3.1.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF PREDICTIVE LIFE CYCLES,10885,"Predictive life cycles expect to take advantage of high certainty around  ﬁrm requirements, a stable team, and low risk. As a result, project activities  often execute in a serial manner, as shown in Figure 3-2. In order to achieve this approach, the team requires detailed plans to  know what to deliver and how. These projects succeed when other potential  changes are restricted (e.g., requirements changes; project team members  change what the team delivers). Team leaders aim to minimize change for  the predictive project. When the team creates detailed requirements and plans at the beginning  of the project, they can articulate the constraints. The team can then use  those constraints to manage risk and cost. As the team progresses through  the detailed plan, they monitor and control changes that might affect the  scope, schedule, or budget. By emphasizing a departmentally efﬁcient, serialized sequence of work,  predictive projects do not typically deliver business value until the end of  the project. If the predictive project encounters changes or disagreements  with the requirements, or if the technological solution is no longer  straightforward, the predictive project will incur unanticipated costs. PLANNING IS ALWAYS THERE A key thing to remember about  life cycles is that each of them  share the element of planning.  What differentiates a life cycle is  not whether planning is done, but  rather how much planning is done  and when. At the predictive end of the  continuum, the plan drives the work.  As much planning as is possible is  performed upfront. Requirements  are identiﬁed in as much detail as  possible. The team estimates when  they can deliver which deliverables  and  performs  comprehensive  procurement activities. In iterative approaches, prototypes  and proofs are also planned, but  the outputs are intended to modify  the plans created in the beginning.  Earlier reviews of unﬁnished work  help inform future project work. Meanwhile, incremental initiatives  plan to deliver successive subsets  of the overall project. Teams may  plan several successive deliveries  in advance or only one at a time.   The deliveries inform the future  project work. Agile projects also plan. The key  difference is that the team plans  and replans as more information  becomes available from review of  frequent deliveries. Regardless of  the project life cycle, the project  requires planning. ","Predictive life cycles expect to take advantage of high certainty around  rm requirements, a stable team, and low risk.

3.1.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF ITERATIVE LIFE CYCLES,10945,"Iterative life cycles improve the product or result through successive prototypes or proofs of concept. Each new  prototype yields new stakeholder feedback and team insights. Then, the team incorporates the new information by  repeating one or more project activities in the next cycle. Teams may use timeboxing on a given iteration for a few  weeks, gather insights, and then rework the activity based on those insights. In that way, iterations help identify and  reduce uncertainty in the project. Projects beneﬁt from iterative life cycles when complexity is high, when the project incurs frequent changes, or when  the scope is subject to differing stakeholders’ views of the desired ﬁnal product. Iterative life cycles may take longer  because they are optimized for learning rather than speed of delivery.

3.1.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF INCREMENTAL LIFE CYCLES,10971,"Some projects optimize for speed of delivery.

3.1.4 CHARACTERISTICS OF AGILE LIFE CYCLES,11045,"In an agile environment, the team expects requirements to change. The iterative and incremental approaches provide  feedback to better plan the next part of the project. However, in agile projects, incremental delivery uncovers hidden  or misunderstood requirements. Figure 3-5 illustrates two possible ways to achieve incremental delivery so the project  aligns with customer needs and can be adapted as necessary. Figure 3-5.

Requirements Analysis Design Build Test the number of features in the WIP limit Requirements Analysis Design Build Test the number of features in the WIP limit NOTE: In flow, the time it takes to complete a feature is not the same for each feature. Flow-Based Agile 25 In iteration-based agile, the team works in iterations (timeboxes of equal duration) to deliver completed features.  The team works on the most important feature, collaborating as a team to ﬁnish it. Then the team works on the next  most important feature and ﬁnishes it. The team may decide to work on a few features at a time, but the team does  not address all of the work for the iteration at once (i.e., does not address all of the requirements, followed by all of the  analyses, etc.). In ﬂow-based agile, the team pulls features from the backlog based on its capacity to start work rather than on  an iteration-based schedule. The team deﬁnes its workﬂow with columns on a task board and manages the work in  progress for each column. Each feature may take a different amount of time to ﬁnish. Teams keep work-in-progress  sizes small to better identify issues early and reduce rework should changes be required. Without iterations to deﬁne  planning and review points, the team and business stakeholders determine the most appropriate schedule for planning,  product reviews, and retrospectives. Agile life cycles are those that fulﬁll the principles of the Agile Manifesto. In particular, customer satisfaction increases  with early and continuous delivery of valuable products. Moreover, an incremental deliverable that is functional and  provides value is the primary measure of progress. Agile life cycles combine both iterative and incremental approaches  in order to adapt to high degrees of change and deliver project value more often.","In an agile environment, the team expects requirements to change.

Requirements Analysis Design Build Test the number of features in the WIP limit Requirements Analysis Design Build Test the number of features in the WIP limit NOTE: In flow, the time it takes to complete a feature is not the same for each feature. FlowBased Agile 25 In iterationbased agile, the team works in iterations  to deliver completed features.  The team works on the most important feature, collaborating as a team to nish it. Then the team works on the next  most important feature and nishes it. The team may decide to work on a few features at a time, but the team does  not address all of the work for the iteration at once . In owbased agile, the team pulls features from the backlog based on its capacity to start work rather than on  an iterationbased schedule. The team denes its workow with columns on a task board and manages the work in  progress for each column. Each feature may take a different amount of time to nish. Teams keep workinprogress  sizes small to better identify issues early and reduce rework should changes be required. Without iterations to dene  planning and review points, the team and business stakeholders determine the most appropriate schedule for planning,  product reviews, and retrospectives. Agile life cycles are those that fulll the principles of the Agile Manifesto. In particular, customer satisfaction increases  with early and continuous delivery of valuable products. Moreover, an incremental deliverable that is functional and  provides value is the primary measure of progress. Agile life cycles combine both iterative and incremental approaches  in order to adapt to high degrees of change and deliver project value more often."
3.1.5 AGILE SUITABILITY FILTERS,11146,Various assessment models exist to help determine the likely ﬁt or gaps for using agile approaches. These models  assess project and organizational factors associated with adoption and suitability and then provide scores indicating  alignment or potential risk areas. Appendix X3 provides a synthesis of popular assessment models for use as an agile  suitability ﬁlter. ,Various assessment models exist to help determine the likely t or gaps for using agile approaches.

3.1.6 CHARACTERISTICS OF HYBRID LIFE CYCLES,11153,"It is not necessary to use a single approach for an entire project. Projects  often combine elements of different life cycles in order to achieve certain  goals. A combination of predictive, iterative, incremental, and/or agile  approaches is a hybrid approach. Figure 3-6 depicts the basic, pure approaches to project types that  combine to form a hybrid model. The early processes utilize an agile  development life cycle, which is then followed by a predictive rollout phase.  This approach can be used when there is uncertainty, complexity, and risk  in the development portion of the project that would beneﬁt from an agile  approach, followed by a deﬁned, repeatable rollout phase that is appropriate  to undertake in a predictive way, perhaps by a different team. An example  of this approach is the development of a new high-tech product followed by  rollout and training to thousands of users. EXAMPLE OF A HYBRID LIFE  CYCLE PROJECT A pharmaceutical company that  had a time-consuming U.S. Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) approval  process tagged onto the end of its  development process and its entire  life cycle looked like Figure 3-6.  While project teams undertook drug  trials in an agile fashion, they had  to present the drugs to an external  group to perform the FDA approval  process. A consultant helped to  integrate the FDA approval process  portion into the agile development  process to create a more streamlined  hybrid approach. The short version of the story  is that because FDA approval is  required to be completed at the  end of the development process  or repeated after any change  (this includes even after the most  minor change), the process had  to remain at the end as a separate  phase.  Integration  using  the  iterative process was unsuccessful.  However, the consultant created  some useful quick-start guides and  testing protocols that shortened the  ﬁnal FDA approval process.

3.1.7 COMBINED AGILE AND PREDICTIVE APPROACHES,11203,"Another approach is to use a combination of agile and predictive approaches throughout the life cycle. Figure 3-7. A Combined Agile and Predictive Approach Used Simultaneously In Figure 3-7, a combination of both predictive and agile approaches are used in the same project. Perhaps the team is  incrementally transitioning to agile and using some approaches like short iterations, daily standups, and retrospectives,  but other aspects of the project such as upfront estimation, work assignment, and progress tracking are still following  predictive approaches. Using both predictive and agile approaches is a common scenario. It would be misleading to call the approach agile  since it clearly does not fully embody the agile mindset, values, and principles. However, it would also be inaccurate to  call it predictive since it is a hybrid approach.

3.1.10 HYBRID LIFE CYCLES AS FIT-FOR-PURPOSE,11261,"Project teams may design a hybrid life cycle based on project risks. For  example, a campus construction project may have multiple buildings to  improve and build. An incremental approach would focus resources on  completing some buildings earlier than others, accelerating the return  on investment. Each individual delivery may be sufﬁciently well known to  beneﬁt from a predictive life cycle for that building alone. The goal of project management is to produce business value in the  best possible way given the current environment. It does not matter if  that way is agile or predictive. The question to ask is: “How can we be  most successful?” Is feedback needed as the team produces value? If so, increments will  help. Is it necessary to manage risk as ideas are explored? If so, iterations  or agile will help. When the organization cannot deliver intermediate value, agile  approaches may not be useful. That is okay—agile for the sake of agile is  not the goal. The point is to select a life cycle or a combination of life cycles  that work for the project, the risks, and the culture. Agile is about customer-based delivery on a frequent basis. That delivery  creates feedback for the team. The team uses that feedback to plan and  replan the next chunk of work. A government department had  a  credit  insurance  application  development project. The multi- year project was to replace its aging  underwriting system with a new,  more responsive user interface and  system integrations. The bulk of  the project was undertaken using  an agile approach with continual  business input. The premium rate calculations  were handed down from the  Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD)  as a 200-page speciﬁcation. The  steps were very clearly explained  with little opportunity for confusion  (or interim result conﬁrmation by  the business) and were coded up  by a separate team working its way  through the calculation steps. The  two teams collaborated on the input  variables required for the calculation  and how to consume and display the  output values, but beyond that, the  calculation team worked in a largely  predictive manner. When the calculation team’s  portion was complete, the outputs  from the premium rate calculations  were displayed on the screens and in  the reports. Then the business users  provided feedback on the appearance  and use of the information. The two  teams ran concurrently, but had little  need for interaction. Having them  physically close to each other made  it easier to check in on development  progress, but largely they were  separate subprojects.

3.1.11 HYBRID LIFE CYCLES AS TRANSITION STRATEGY,11327,"Many teams are not able to make the switch to agile ways of working overnight. Agile techniques look and feel  very different to those who are accustomed to and have been successful in a predictive environment. The larger the  organization and the more moving parts, the longer it will take to transition. For that reason, it makes sense to plan a  gradual transition. A gradual transition involves adding more iterative techniques to improve learning and alignment among teams and  stakeholders. Later, consider adding more incremental techniques to accelerate value and return on investment to  sponsors. This combination of various approaches is considered a hybrid approach. Try these new techniques on a less risky project with a medium- to low-degree of uncertainty. Then, when the  organization is successful with a hybrid approach, try more complex projects that require more of those techniques to  be added. This is a way to tailor the progressive hybrid transition to the organization’s situation and speciﬁc risks and  the team’s readiness to adapt and embrace the changes.

3.2 MIXING AGILE APPROACHES,11340,"Agile teams rarely limit their practices to one agile approach. Each project  context has its own peculiarities, such as the varied mix of team member  skills and backgrounds; the various components of the product under  development; and the age, scale, criticality, complexity, and regulatory  constraints of the environment in which the work takes place. Agile frameworks are not customized for the team. The team may need  to tailor practices to deliver value on a regular basis. Often, teams practice  their own special blend of agile, even if they use a particular framework as  a starting point. BLENDING APPROACHES As an example of tailoring agile  frameworks, one of the most  common blends in widespread  use involves a coordinated use of  the Scrum framework, the Kanban  Method, and elements of the eXtreme  Programming (XP) method. Scrum  provides guidance on the use of a  product backlog, a product owner,  scrum master, and a cross-functional  development team, including sprint  planning, daily scrum, sprint review,  and sprint retrospective sessions.  A kanban board helps the team to  further improve its effectiveness  by visualizing the ﬂow of work,  making impediments easily visible,  and allowing ﬂow to be managed  by adjusting work in process limits.  In addition, XP-inspired engineering  practices such as use of story cards,  continuous integration, refactoring,  automated testing, and test-driven  development further increase the  effectiveness of the agile team. In  summary, the blend of practices  from these various sources produces  a synergistic result of higher  performance than each individual  component in isolation. 32    Section 3","Agile teams rarely limit their practices to one agile approach.

4.2 SERVANT LEADERSHIP EMPOWERS THE TEAM,11438,"Agile approaches emphasize servant leadership as a way to empower teams. Servant leadership is the practice of  leading through service to the team, by focusing on understanding and addressing the needs and development of team  members in order to enable the highest possible team performance. The role of a servant leader is to facilitate the team’s discovery and deﬁnition of agile. Servant leaders practice and  radiate agile. Servant leaders approach project work in this order: u u Purpose. Work with the team to deﬁne the “why” or purpose so they can engage and coalesce around the goal  for the project. The entire team optimizes at the project level, not the person level. u u People. Once the purpose is established, encourage the team to create an environment where everyone can  succeed. Ask each team member to contribute across the project work. u u Process. Do not plan on following the “perfect” agile process, but instead look for the results. When a cross- functional team delivers ﬁnished value often and reﬂects on the product and process, the teams are agile. It does  not matter what the team calls its process. 34    Section 4 The following characteristics of servant leadership enable project leaders to become more agile and facilitate the  team’s success: u u Promoting self-awareness; u u Listening; u u Serving those on the team; u u Helping people grow; u u Coaching vs. controlling; u u Promoting safety, respect, and trust; and u u Promoting the energy and intelligence of others. Servant leadership is not unique to agile. But once having practiced it, servant leaders can usually see how well  servant leadership integrates into the agile mindset and value. When leaders develop their servant leadership or facilitative skills, they are more likely to become agile. As a result,  servant leaders can help their teams collaborate to deliver value faster. Successful agile teams embrace the growth mindset, where people believe they can learn new skills.

4.2.1 SERVANT LEADER RESPONSIBILITIES,11478,"Servant leaders manage relationships to build communication and coordination within the team and across the  organization. These relationships help the leaders navigate the organization to support the team. This kind of support  helps to remove impediments and facilitates the team to streamline its processes. Because servant leaders understand  agile and practice a speciﬁc approach to agile, they can assist in fulﬁlling the team’s needs. 35 4.2.1.1 SERVANT LEADERS FACILITATE When project managers act as servant leaders, the emphasis shifts from “managing coordination” to “facilitating  collaboration.” Facilitators help everyone do their best thinking and work. Facilitators encourage the team’s participation,  understanding, and shared responsibility for the team’s output. Facilitators help the team create acceptable solutions. Servant leaders promote collaboration and conversation within the team and between teams. For example, a  servant leader helps to expose and communicate bottlenecks inside and between teams. Then the teams resolve  those bottlenecks. Additionally, a facilitator encourages collaboration through interactive meetings, informal dialog, and knowledge  sharing. Servant leaders do this by becoming impartial bridge-builders and coaches, rather than by making decisions  for which others should be responsible. 4.2.1.2 SERVANT LEADERS REMOVE ORGANIZATIONAL IMPEDIMENTS The ﬁrst value of the Agile Manifesto is individuals and interactions over processes and tools. What better responsibility  for a servant leader to take on than to take a hard look at processes that are impeding a team’s or organization’s  agility and work to streamline them? For example, if a department requires extensive documentation, the role of the  servant leader could be to work with that department to review required documentation, assist with creating a shared  understanding of how agile deliverables meet those requirements, and evaluate the amount of documentation required  so teams are spending more time delivering a valuable product instead of producing exhaustive documentation. Servant leaders should also look at other processes that are lengthy, causing bottlenecks and impeding a team’s or  organization’s agility. Examples of processes or departments that may need to be addressed include ﬁnance, change  control boards, or audits. Servant leaders can partner and work with others to challenge them to review their processes  to support agile teams and leaders. For example, what good is it for the team to deliver working product every 2 weeks  only to have the product fall into a queue or process that could take 6 or more weeks to release due to lengthy release  processes? Far too many organizations have these “bottleneck” processes that prevent teams from quickly delivering  valuable products or services. The servant leader has the ability to change or remove these organizational impediments  to support delivery teams. 36    Section 4 4.2.1.3 SERVANT LEADERS PAVE THE WAY FOR OTHERS’  CONTRIBUTION In agile, the team manages its work process and its work product. That  self-management and self-organization applies to everyone serving and  supporting the organization and project. Servant leaders work to fulﬁll  the needs of the teams, projects, and organization. Servant leaders may  work with facilities for a team space, work with management to enable the  team to focus on one project at a time, or work with the product owner to  develop stories with the team. Some servant leaders work with auditors to  reﬁne the processes needed in regulatory environments, and some servant  leaders work with the ﬁnance department to transition the organization to  incremental budgeting. The servant leader focuses on paving the way for the team to do its  best work. The servant leader inﬂuences projects and encourages the  organization to think differently. 4.2.1.4 CONSIDER THESE SERVANT LEADER RESPONSIBILITIES Servant leaders can have many possible titles, but what is most important  is what they do. Here are some examples of the responsibilities a servant  leader may have: INTERPERSONAL SKILLS VERSUS  TECHNICAL SKILLS In addition to servant leadership,  team members emphasize their  interpersonal  and  emotional  intelligence  skills—not  just  technical skills. Everyone on the  team works to exhibit more initiative,  integrity, emotional intelligence,  honesty,  collaboration,  humility,  and willingness to communicate in  various ways so that the entire team  can work together well. The team needs these skills so  they can respond well to changes  in project direction and technical  product changes. When everyone  can adapt to the work and to each  other, the entire team is more likely  to succeed. 37 u u Educate stakeholders around why and how to be agile. Explain the beneﬁts of business value based on  prioritization, greater accountability and productivity of empowered teams, and improved quality from more  frequent reviews, etc. u u Support the team through mentoring, encouragement, and support. Advocate for team members training and  career development. The oxymoronic quote “We lead teams by standing behind them” speaks to the role of the  leader in developing their team members. Through support, encouragement, and professional development,  team members gain conﬁdence, take on larger roles, and contribute at higher levels within their organizations. A  key role of the servant leader is to nurture and grow team members through and beyond their current roles, even  if that means losing them from the team. u u Help the team with technical project management activities like quantitative risk analysis. Sometimes team  members may not have knowledge or experience in roles or functions. Servant leaders who may have more  exposure or training in techniques can support the team by providing training or undertaking these activities. u u Celebrate team successes and support and bridge building activities with external groups. Create upward spirals  of appreciation and good will for increased collaboration.","Servant leaders manage relationships to build communication and coordination within the team and across the  organization.

For example, if a department requires extensive documentation, the role of the  servant leader could be to work with that department to review required documentation, assist with creating a shared  understanding of how agile deliverables meet those requirements, and evaluate the amount of documentation required  so teams are spending more time delivering a valuable product instead of producing exhaustive documentation. Servant leaders should also look at other processes that are lengthy, causing bottlenecks and impeding a teams or  organizations agility. Examples of processes or departments that may need to be addressed include nance, change  control boards, or audits. Servant leaders can partner and work with others to challenge them to review their processes  to support agile teams and leaders. For example, what good is it for the team to deliver working product every 2 weeks  only to have the product fall into a queue or process that could take 6 or more weeks to release due to lengthy release  processes? Far too many organizations have these bottleneck processes that prevent teams from quickly delivering  valuable products or services. The servant leader has the ability to change or remove these organizational impediments  to support delivery teams. 36    Section 4 4.2.1.3 SERVANT LEADERS PAVE THE WAY FOR OTHERS  CONTRIBUTION In agile, the team manages its work process and its work product. That  selfmanagement and selforganization applies to everyone serving and  supporting the organization and project. Servant leaders work to fulll  the needs of the teams, projects, and organization. Servant leaders may  work with facilities for a team space, work with management to enable the  team to focus on one project at a time, or work with the product owner to  develop stories with the team. Some servant leaders work with auditors to  rene the processes needed in regulatory environments, and some servant  leaders work with the nance department to transition the organization to  incremental budgeting. The servant leader focuses on paving the way for the team to do its  best work. The servant leader inuences projects and encourages the  organization to think differently. 4.2.1.4 CONSIDER THESE SERVANT LEADER RESPONSIBILITIES Servant leaders can have many possible titles, but what is most important  is what they do. Here are some examples of the responsibilities a servant  leader may have: INTERPERSONAL SKILLS VERSUS  TECHNICAL SKILLS In addition to servant leadership,  team members emphasize their  interpersonal  and  emotional  intelligence  skillsnot  just  technical skills. Everyone on the  team works to exhibit more initiative,  integrity, emotional intelligence,  honesty,  collaboration,  humility,  and willingness to communicate in  various ways so that the entire team  can work together well. The team needs these skills so  they can respond well to changes  in project direction and technical  product changes. When everyone  can adapt to the work and to each  other, the entire team is more likely  to succeed. 37 u u Educate stakeholders around why and how to be agile. Explain the benets of business value based on  prioritization, greater accountability and productivity of empowered teams, and improved quality from more  frequent reviews, etc. u u Support the team through mentoring, encouragement, and support. Advocate for team members training and  career development. The oxymoronic quote We lead teams by standing behind them speaks to the role of the  leader in developing their team members. Through support, encouragement, and professional development,  team members gain condence, take on larger roles, and contribute at higher levels within their organizations. A  key role of the servant leader is to nurture and grow team members through and beyond their current roles, even  if that means losing them from the team. u u Help the team with technical project management activities like quantitative risk analysis. Sometimes team  members may not have knowledge or experience in roles or functions. Servant leaders who may have more  exposure or training in techniques can support the team by providing training or undertaking these activities. u u Celebrate team successes and support and bridge building activities with external groups. Create upward spirals  of appreciation and good will for increased collaboration."
4.2.2 ROLE OF THE PROJECT MANAGER IN AN AGILE ENVIRONMENT,11575,"The role of the project manager in an agile project is somewhat of an unknown, because many agile frameworks  and approaches do not address the role of the project manager. Some agile practitioners think the role of a project  manager is not needed, due to self-organizing teams taking on the former responsibilities of the project manager.  However, pragmatic agile practitioners and organizations realize that project managers can add signiﬁcant value in  many situations. The key difference is that their roles and responsibilities look somewhat different.

4.2.3 PROJECT MANAGERS USE SERVANT LEADERSHIP,11585,"The PMBOK® Guide – Sixth Edition, deﬁnes the project manager as “the person assigned by the performing  organization to lead the team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives.” Many project managers are accustomed to being at the center of coordination for the project, tracking and  representing the team’s status to the rest of the organization. This approach was ﬁne when projects were decomposed  into siloed functions. However, in high-change projects, there is more complexity than one person can manage.

4.3.1 AGILE TEAMS,11613,"Agile teams focus on rapid product development so they can obtain feedback. In practice, the most effective agile  teams tend to range in size from three to nine members. Ideally, agile teams are colocated in a team space. Team  members are 100% dedicated to the teams. Agile encourages self-managing teams, where team members decide who  will perform the work within the next period’s deﬁned scope. Agile teams thrive with servant leadership. The leaders  support the teams’ approach to their work. Cross-functional agile teams produce functional product increments frequently. That is because the teams collectively  own the work and together have all of the necessary skills to deliver completed work. Regardless of the overall agile approach, the more a team limits its work in progress, the more likely its members  can collaborate to expedite work across the board. Team members in successful agile teams work to collaborate in  various ways (such as pairing, swarming, and mobbing) so they do not fall into the trap of mini-waterfalls instead of  collaborative work. Mini-waterfalls occur when the team addresses all of the requirements in a given period, then  attempts to do all of the design, then moves on to do all of the building. Using this scenario, at some point in the building  or the testing following the building, the team may realize it had assumptions that are no longer valid. In this case, the  team wasted time in addressing all of the requirements. Instead, when team members collaborate to produce a small  number of features across the board, they learn as they proceed and deliver smaller ﬁnished features.

4.3.3 GENERALIZING SPECIALISTS,11720,"Agile teams are cross-functional, but the people often do not start off that  way. However, many successful agile teams are made up of generalizing  specialists, or “T-shaped” people. This means team members have both a focus specialty plus a breadth  of experience across multiple skills, rather than a single specialization.  Agile team members work to develop such characteristics due to intense  collaboration and self-organization to swarm and get work done quickly,  which requires them to routinely help each other. A single person’s throughput is not relevant. Focusing on a single  person’s throughput may even be harmful if it creates a bottleneck for the  rest of the team. The goal is for the team to optimize the delivery of ﬁnished  work to get feedback. If the customer desires great results, such as rapid feature delivery with  excellent quality, the team cannot be structured just with specialist roles  in an attempt to maximize resource efﬁciency. The team’s objective is ﬂow  efﬁciency, optimizing the throughput of the entire team. Small batch sizes  promote working together as a team. The product owner’s job is to make  sure the team works on the highest-value work. “I-SHAPED PEOPLE AND  T-SHAPED PEOPLE” Some  people  have  deep  specializations in one domain, but  rarely contribute outside of that  domain. These people are known  in agile communities as “I-shaped  people” since, like the letter “I,”  they have depth, but not much  breadth. By contrast “T-shaped  people” supplement their expertise  in one area with supporting, but  less-developed skills in associated  areas and good collaboration skills.  As an example, a person who can  test some areas of the product  and develop different areas of  the product is considered to be a  T-shaped person. A T-shaped person has a  deﬁned, recognized specialization  and primary role, but has the  skills, versatility, and aptitude for  collaboration to help other people  when and where necessary. This  collaboration reduces hand-offs and  the constraints of only one person  being able to do the job. 43","Agile teams are crossfunctional, but the people often do not start off that  way.

4.3.4 TEAM STRUCTURES,11771,"Teams have adopted agile principles and practices across many industries. They organize people into cross-functional  teams to iteratively develop working products. Some organizations have been able to create colocated, cross-functional teams; others have a different situation.  Instead of having all team members colocated, some organizations have distributed or dispersed teams. Distributed  teams have cross-functional teams in different locations. Dispersed teams may have each team member working in a  completely different location, either in an ofﬁce or from home. While these arrangements are not ideal due to increased  communication costs, they may still be workable. C A S E The core team assembled to write this practice guide had varied backgrounds—some  represented PMI and some represented Agile Alliance. They were self-organizing and worked in  increments to complete the work. PMI assembled a group of subject matter experts to inspect  the work, and this allowed the team to incorporate feedback and improve the product as it was  developed. However the core team was not representative of a typical agile team because its  members’ time was not 100% dedicated to this endeavor. 44    Section 4","Teams have adopted agile principles and practices across many industries.

4.3.5 DEDICATED TEAM MEMBERS,11788,"What happens when the team members’ time is not 100% dedicated to the team? While this condition is not ideal,  unfortunately, it sometimes cannot be avoided. The key problem with having someone invest only a capacity of 25% or 50% on the team is that they will multitask  and task switch. Multitasking reduces the throughput of the team’s work and impacts the team’s ability to predict  delivery consistently. 2 A follow-the-sun development process is one where work is handed off at the end of every day from one site to the  next, many time zones away in order to speed up product development. In one large, U.S.-based ﬁnancial institution there was a program with a set of teams where the team members  were based on the East Coast of the United States and several locations throughout India. When the team ﬁrst started,  it was one large dispersed team (UX, analysts, developers, and testers) doing a “follow the sun”2 development practice  where some working time overlapped across the team members to do warm hand-offs with the work. Team members  conducted daily standups together and used webcams to include all team members. Key roles (analysts, product owners,  UX designers, and development leads) in the U.S. would come in early to answer any questions from their India-based  team members and help to resolve impediments. As the product started getting larger, and more funding came through, they decided to break into ﬁve smaller teams.  To do this, they decided to build colocated, distributed teams in various locations. They made the decision to build cross- functional, colocated teams in each of these locations consisting of developers and testers. They also had a core set of analysts, based in the two U.S. locations, who worked with their U.S.-based product  manager and product owners and then worked with each of the teams, respectively. Although they had some structure  in place where they conducted product reviews as an entire program, most of the other activities were conducted at a  team level, based on what worked best for each team, to allow them to self-organize. TIP Multitasking slows the progress of the entire team, because team members waste time context  switching and/or waiting for each other to ﬁnish other work. When people are 100% dedicated to the  team, the team has the fastest possible throughput. 45 People experience productivity losses somewhere between 20% and 40% when task switching. The loss increases  exponentially with the number of tasks. When a person multitasks between two projects, that person is not 50% on each project. Instead, due to the cost of  task switching, the person is somewhere between 20% and 40% on each project. People are more likely to make mistakes when they multitask. Task-switching consumes working memory and  people are less likely to remember their context when they multitask. When everyone on the team is 100% allocated to one project, they can continuously collaborate as a team, making  everyone’s work more effective. See Table A1-2 on Project Management Process Group and Knowledge Area Mapping for more tips on teams in agile  environments, speciﬁcally the processes in the Project Resource Management Knowledge Area. TIP Not all teams have all the roles that they need. For example, some teams need support from database  administrators or research analysts. When a team has temporarily assigned specialists, it is important  to ensure that everyone has the same set of expectations. Is this specialist 100% allocated to the team  and for how long? Set expectations with everyone (the specialist and the team) to clarify the level of  commitment so the team can deliver. Part-time assignments create risks for the project. C A S E Since core team members developing this practice guide cannot dedicate 100% of their  capacity to the team’s efforts, their throughput is substantially lower than what it might be  if they could afford to collocate and invest their attention full-time to the project. However,  while it is economically viable to collaborate, even if dispersed and operating at a fraction of  their full capacity, it is not feasible to colocate and focus at full capacity. Therefore, the team  identiﬁed their dispersion as a potential risk.

4.3.6 TEAM WORKSPACES,11842,"Teams need a space in which they can work together, to understand their state as a team, and to collaborate. Some  agile teams all work in one room together. Some teams have a team workspace for their standups and charts, and work  on their own in cubicles or ofﬁces. While companies are moving toward open, collaborative work environments, organizations also need to create quiet  spaces for workers who need uninterrupted time to think and work. Therefore, companies are designing their ofﬁces to  balance common and social areas (sometimes called “caves and common”) with quiet areas or private spaces where  individuals can work without being interrupted. When teams have geographically distributed members, the team decides how much of their workplace is virtual and  how much is physical. Technology such as document sharing, video conferencing, and other virtual collaboration tools  help people collaborate remotely. Geographically distributed teams need virtual workspaces. In addition, consider getting the team together in person  at regular intervals so the team can build trust and learn how to work together. Some techniques to consider for managing communication in dispersed teams are fishbowl windows and  remote pairing: u u Create a ﬁshbowl window by setting up long-lived video conferencing links between the various locations in  which the team is dispersed. People start the link at the beginning of a workday, and close it at the end. In  this way, people can see and engage spontaneously with each other, reducing the collaboration lag otherwise  inherent in the geographical separation. u u Set up remote pairing by using virtual conferencing tools to share screens, including voice and video links. As  long as the time zone differences are accounted for, this may prove almost as effective as face-to-face pairing.

4.3.7 OVERCOMING ORGANIZATIONAL SILOS,11869,"The best place to start when forming agile teams is by building a foundational trust and a safe work environment to  ensure that all team members have an equal voice and can be heard and considered. This, along with building the agile  mindset is the underlying success factor—all other challenges and risks can be mitigated. Often, siloed organizations create impediments for forming cross-functional agile teams. The team members  needed to build the cross-functional teams typically report to different managers and have different metrics by which  managers measure their performance. Managers need to focus on ﬂow efﬁciency (and team-based metrics) rather  than resource efﬁciency. To overcome organizational silos, work with the various managers of these team members and have them dedicate the  necessary individuals to the cross-functional team. This not only creates team synergy but also allows the organization  to see how leveraging its people will optimize the project or product being built. For more information about teams see Appendix X2 on Attributes that Inﬂuence Tailoring. TIP As an agile project leader, ﬁrst focus on how you can create a team that is cross-functional and 100%  dedicated to one team. Even if it means just getting key team members, such as the developers and testers,  to work and communicate together on a daily basis, that is a step in the right direction toward agility.

5.1 CHARTER THE PROJECT AND THE TEAM,11891,"Every project needs a project charter so the project team knows why this project matters, where the team is headed  and what the project objective is. However, the project charter itself may not be enough for the team. Agile teams  require team norms and an understanding of how to work together. In that case, the team might need a team charter. The chartering process helps the team learn how to work together and coalesce around the project. At a minimum, for an agile project, the team needs the project vision or purpose and a clear set of working agreements.  An agile project charter answers these questions: u u Why are we doing this project? This is the project vision. u u Who beneﬁts and how? This may be part of the project vision and/or project purpose. u u What does done mean for the project? These are the project’s release criteria. u u How are we going to work together?

5.2.1 RETROSPECTIVES,11929,"The single most important practice is the retrospective because it allows the team to learn about, improve, and adapt  its process. Retrospectives help the team learn from its previous work on the product and its process. One of the principles  behind the Agile Manifesto is: “At regular intervals, the team reﬂects on how to become more effective, then tunes and  adjusts its behavior accordingly.” 51 Many teams use iterations—especially 2-week iterations—because the iteration prompts a demonstration and a  retrospective at the end. However, the team does not need iterations in order to retrospect. Team members may decide  to retrospect at these key times: u u When the team completes a release or ships something. It does not have to be a monumental increment. It can  be any release, no matter how small. u u When more than a few weeks have passed since the previous retrospective. u u When the team appears to be stuck and completed work is not ﬂowing through the team. u u When the team reaches any other milestone. Teams beneﬁt from allocating enough time to learn, either from an interim retrospective or an end-of-the-project  retrospective. Teams need to learn about their work product and work process. For example, some teams have trouble  ﬁnishing work. When teams plan enough time, they can structure their retrospective to gather data, process that data,  and decide what to try later as an experiment. First and foremost, a retrospective is not about blame; the retrospective is a time for the team to learn from previous  work and make small improvements.  The retrospective is about looking at the qualitative (people’s feelings) and quantitative (measurements) data, then  using that data to ﬁnd root causes, designing countermeasures, and developing action plans. The project team may end  up with many action items to remove impediments. Consider limiting the number of action items to the team’s capacity to address improvement in the upcoming iteration  or work period. Trying to improve too many things at once and not ﬁnishing any of them is much worse than planning to  complete fewer items and successfully completing all of them. Then, when time allows, the team can work on the next  improvement opportunity on the list. When the team selects the improvements, decide how to measure the outcomes.  Then, in the next time period, measure the outcomes to validate success or failure of each improvement. A facilitator from the team leads them through an activity to rank the importance of each improvement item. Once the  improvement items are ranked by the team, the team chooses the appropriate number to work on for the next iteration  (or adds work to the ﬂow if ﬂow-based). 52    Section 5","The single most important practice is the retrospective because it allows the team to learn about, improve, and adapt  its process.

5.2.2 BACKLOG PREPARATION,11967,"The backlog is the ordered list of all the work, presented in story form, for a team. There is no need to create all of the  stories for the entire project before the work starts—only enough to understand the ﬁrst release in broad brushstrokes  and then sufﬁcient items for the next iteration. Product owners (or a product owner value team that includes the product manager and all relevant product owners  for that area of the product,) might produce a product roadmap to show the anticipated sequence of deliverables over  time. The product owner replans the roadmap based on what the team produces.

Under normal circumstances,  the product owner leads this work. A servant leader can facilitate any necessary meetings as a way of  serving the project. 53 Reﬁnement meetings allow the product owner to present story ideas to the team and for the team to learn about the  potential challenges or problems in the stories. If the product owner is unsure of the dependencies, the product owner  can request the team to spike the feature in order to understand the risks. There are many ways for the product owner to conduct backlog preparation and reﬁnement meetings, including  for example: u u Encourage the team to work as triads of developer, tester, business analyst/product owner to discuss and write  the story. u u Present the overall story concept to the team. The team discusses and reﬁnes it into as many stories as required. u u Work with the team to ﬁnd various ways to explore and write the stories together, making sure all of the stories  are small enough so the team can produce a steady ﬂow of completed work. Consider becoming able to complete  a story at least once a day. Teams often have a goal of spending not more than 1 hour per week reﬁning stories for the next batch of work.  Teams want to maximize the time spent doing work as opposed to planning work. If the team needs to spend more than  1 hour per week reﬁning stories, the product owner could be overpreparing, or the team may be lacking some critical  skills needed to evaluate and reﬁne the work.","In iterationbased agile, the product owner often works with the team to prepare some stories for the upcoming  iteration during one or more sessions in the middle of the iteration.

5.2.4 DAILY STANDUPS,12011,"Teams use standups to microcommit to each other, uncover problems, and ensure the work ﬂows smoothly through  the team. Timebox the standup to no longer than 15 minutes. The team “walks” the Kanban or task board in some way, and  anyone from the team can facilitate the standup. In iteration-based agile, everyone answers the following questions in a round-robin fashion: u u What did I complete since the last standup? u u What am I planning to complete between now and the next standup? u u What are my impediments (or risks or problems)? 54    Section 5 Questions like these generate answers that allow the team to self-organize and hold each other accountable for  completing the work they committed to the day before and throughout the iteration. Flow-based agile has a different approach to standups, focusing on the team’s throughput. The team assesses the  board from right to left. The questions are: u u What do we need to do to advance this piece of work? u u Is anyone working on anything that is not on the board? u u What do we need to ﬁnish as a team? u u Are there any bottlenecks or blockers to the ﬂow of work? One of the antipatterns typically seen in standups is they become status meetings. Teams who have traditionally  worked in a predictive environment may tend to fall into this antipattern since they are used to providing a status. Another antipattern typically seen in standups is that the team begins to solve problems as they become apparent.  Standups are for realizing there are problems—not for solving them. Add the issues to a parking lot, and then create  another meeting, which might be right after the standup, and solve problems there. Teams run their own standups. When run well, standups can be very useful, provided the nature of the team’s  work requires intense collaboration. Make a conscious decision about when the team needs, or can effectively  use, standups. TIP Encourage any team member to facilitate the standup instead of a project manager or leader to ensure  it does not turn into a status meeting, but instead is used as a time for the team to self-organize and make  commitments to each other. 55","Teams use standups to microcommit to each other, uncover problems, and ensure the work ows smoothly through  the team.

5.2.5 DEMONSTRATIONS/REVIEWS,12050,"As the team completes the features usually in the form of user stories, the team periodically demonstrates the  working product. The product owner sees the demonstration and accepts or declines stories. In iteration-based agile, the team demonstrates all completed work items at the end of the iteration. In ﬂow- based agile, the team demonstrates completed work when it is time to do so, usually when enough features have  accumulated into a set that is coherent. Teams, including the product owner, need feedback to decide how early to  ask for product feedback. As a general guideline, demonstrate whatever the team has as a working product at least once every 2 weeks. That  frequency is enough for most teams, so team members can get feedback that prevents them from heading in a wrong  direction. That is also frequent enough so that the teams can keep the product development clean enough to build a  complete product as often as they want or need to. A fundamental part of what makes a project agile is the frequent delivery of a working product. A team that does  not demonstrate or release cannot learn fast enough and is likely not adopting agile techniques. The team may require  additional coaching to enable frequent delivery.","As the team completes the features usually in the form of user stories, the team periodically demonstrates the  working product.

5.2.6 PLANNING FOR ITERATION-BASED AGILE,12064,"Each team’s capacity is different. Each product owner’s typical story size is different. Teams consider their story size  so they do not try to commit to more stories than there is team capacity to complete within one iteration. When people are unavailable (e.g., holidays, vacations, or anything that prevents people from participating in the next  set of work), the product owner understands that the team has reduced capacity. The team will not be able to ﬁnish the  same amount of work as it ﬁnished in the previous time period. When teams have a reduced capacity, they will only  plan for work that meets that capacity. Teams estimate what they can complete, which is a measure of capacity (see Section 4.10 for examples). Teams  cannot predict with 100% certainty what they can deliver, as they cannot know the unexpected. When product owners  make the stories smaller and teams see progress in the form of a ﬁnished product, teams learn what they are able to  do for the future. Agile teams do not plan just once in one single chunk. Instead, agile teams plan a little, deliver, learn, and then replan  a little more in an ongoing cycle.

5.2.7 EXECUTION PRACTICES THAT HELP TEAMS DELIVER VALUE,12081,"If the team does not pay attention to quality, it will soon become impossible to release anything rapidly. The following technical practices, many of which come from eXtreme Programming, may help the team to deliver at  their maximum speed: u u Continuous integration. Perform frequent incorporation of work into the whole, no matter the product, and then  retest to determine that the entire product still works as intended. u u Test at all levels. Employ system-level testing for end-to-end information and unit testing for the building  blocks. In between, understand if there is a need for integration testing and where. Teams ﬁnd smoke testing  helpful as a ﬁrst look at whether the work product is any good. Teams have found that deciding when to run  regression tests and which ones helps them maintain product quality with good build performance. Agile teams  have a strong preference for automated tests so they can build and maintain a momentum of delivery. u u Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD). In ATDD, the entire team gets together and discusses the  acceptance criteria for a work product. Then the team creates the tests, which allows the team to write just  enough code and automated tests to meet the criteria. For non-software projects, consider how to test the work  as the team completes chunks of value. u u Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). Writing automated tests before  writing/creating the product actually helps people design and mistake-proof the product. For non-software  projects, consider how to “test-drive” the team’s designs. Hardware and mechanical projects often use  simulations for interim tests of their designs. u u Spikes (timeboxed research or experiments). Spikes are useful for learning and may be used in circumstances  such as: estimation, acceptance criteria deﬁnition, and understanding the ﬂow of a user’s action through the  product. Spikes are helpful when the team needs to learn some critical technical or functional element. 57","If the team does not pay attention to quality, it will soon become impossible to release anything rapidly.

5.4 MEASUREMENTS IN AGILE PROJECTS,12220,"Transitioning to agile means using different measurements. Using agile means looking at new metrics that matter to  the team and to management. These metrics matter because they focus on customer value. One problem with status reporting is the team’s ability to predict completion or to use trafﬁc light status to describe  the project. For instance, project leaders describe the project as “90% done.” At that point the team tries to integrate the  pieces into a product. The team discovers missing requirements or surprises, or ﬁnds that the product doesn’t integrate  the way they thought it would. The project is only partway done, and the trafﬁc light status reporting does not reﬂect the real state. Too often, the  project team realizes it will need just as much time to complete the remainder of the project. For too many projects, the  team realizes they are—at most—10% done because of issues the team discovered. The problem with predictive measurements is that they often do not reﬂect reality. It often happens that a project  status light is green up until 1 month before the release date; this is sometimes referred to as a watermelon project  (green on the outside, red on the inside). Oftentimes project status lights turn red with seemingly no warnings, because  there is no empirical data about the project until 1 month before the release date. Metrics for agile projects contain meaningful information that provide a historical track record, because agile  projects deliver value (ﬁnished work) on a regular basis. Project teams can use such data for improved forecasts and  decision making. Surrogate measurements such as percent done are less useful than empirical measurements such as ﬁnished  features. See Section 4.10 for more information on value management. Agile helps teams see problems and issues so  the team can diagnose and address them. In addition to quantitative measures, the team can consider collecting qualitative measures. Some of these qualitative  measures focus on practices the team has chosen and assess how well the team uses those practices, for example,  the business satisfaction with delivered features, the morale of the team; and anything else the team wants to track as  a qualitative measure. ","Transitioning to agile means using different measurements. Using agile means looking at new metrics that matter to  the team and to management. These metrics matter because they focus on customer value. One problem with status reporting is the teams ability to predict completion or to use trafc light status to describe  the project. For instance, project leaders describe the project as 90 done. At that point the team tries to integrate the  pieces into a product. The team discovers missing requirements or surprises, or nds that the product doesnt integrate  the way they thought it would. The project is only partway done, and the trafc light status reporting does not reect the real state. Too often, the  project team realizes it will need just as much time to complete the remainder of the project. For too many projects, the  team realizes they areat most10 done because of issues the team discovered. The problem with predictive measurements is that they often do not reect reality. It often happens that a project  status light is green up until 1 month before the release date; this is sometimes referred to as a watermelon project  .

5.4.1 AGILE TEAMS MEASURE RESULTS,12245,"Agile favors empirical and value-based measurements instead of  predictive measurements. Agile measures what the team delivers, not what  the team predicts it will deliver. A team that is accustomed to having project baselines and estimates of  earned value and ROI might be puzzled about working on a project and not  managing to a baseline. Agile is based on working products of demonstrable  value to customers. Baselines are often an artifact of attempted prediction. In agile, the team  limits its estimation to the next few weeks at most. In agile, if there is low  variability in the team’s work and if the team members are not multitasking,  the team’s capacity can become stable. This allows better prediction for the  next couple of weeks. After the team completes work in iteration or ﬂow, the team can replan.  Agile does not create the ability to do more work. However, there is evidence  that the smaller the chunk of work, the more likely people are to deliver it. Software product development, like other knowledge work, is about  learning—learning while delivering value. Hardware development and  mechanical development are similar in the design parts of the project.  Learning takes place by experimenting, delivering small increments of  value, and getting feedback on what has been accomplished thus far. Many  other product development projects incorporate learning also. Sponsors usually want to know  when the project will be done. Once  the team establishes a reliable  velocity (average stories or story  points per iteration) or the average  cycle time, the team can predict how  much longer the project will take. As an example, if the team  averages 50 story points per  iteration, and the team estimates  there are about another 500 points  remaining, the team estimates it has  about 10 iterations remaining. As  the product owner reﬁnes the stories  remaining and as the team reﬁnes  its estimates, the project estimate  could go up or down, but the team  can provide an estimate. If the team averages a cycle time  of three days per story and there are  30 remaining stories, the team would  have 90 business days remaining,  approximately 4 to 5 months. Reﬂect the estimate variability  with hurricane-style charts, or some  other variability measure that the  sponsors will understand. 62    Section 5 Because learning is such a large part of the project, the team needs to balance uncertainty and provide value to the  customers. The team plans the next small part of the project. The team reports empirical data and replans further small  increments to manage the project uncertainty. Some iteration-based projects use burndown charts to see where the project is going over time. Figure 5-1 shows an  example of a burndown chart where the team planned to deliver 37 story points. Story points rate the relative work, risk,  and complexity of a requirement or story. Many agile teams use story points to estimate effort. The dotted burndown  line is the plan. In Figure 5-1, the team can see by Day 3 that they are at risk for that delivery. Figure 5-1.

6.1.2 READINESS FOR CHANGE,12659,"Organizations beginning to use agile approaches should understand the relative compatibility of those methods  with their current approaches. Some organizations will have characteristics that more easily support agile principles  of cross-department collaboration, continuous learning, and evolving internal processes. Examples of these change- friendly characteristics include: u u Executive management’s willingness to change; u u Organization’s willingness to shift the way it views, reviews, and assesses employees; u u Centralization or decentralization of project, program, and portfolio management functions; u u Focus on short-term budgeting and metrics versus long-term goals; and u u Talent management maturity and capabilities. 74    Section 6  Conversely, there are other institutional characteristics that may be roadblocks to achieving the changes associated  with organizational agility. Examples of these include: u u Work is decomposed into departmental silos, creating dependencies that prevent accelerated delivery instead of  building cross-functional teams with guidance from centers of competencies. u u Procurement strategies are based on short-term pricing strategies, rather than long-term competencies. u u Leaders are rewarded for local efﬁciencies rather than end-to-end ﬂow of project delivery or optimizing the whole  (in regard to the organization). u u Employees are specialized contributors with limited tools or incentives to diversify their skills instead of building  T-shaped specialists. u u Decentralized portfolios pull employees simultaneously onto too many projects at once instead of keeping them  focused on one project at a time. The degree to which an organization is willing to review and modify these practices will determine how quickly  and effectively agile approaches can be adopted. However, in response to these organizational impediments to agility,  project leaders can try various approaches to accelerate a cultural compatibility for: u u Visible and active executive sponsorship, u u Change management practices, including communication and coaching, u u Progressively pacing the adoption of agile practices on a project-by-project basis u u Incremental introduction of agile practices to the team; and u u Leading by example by using agile techniques and practices where possible.

6.2.2 ASSESSING CULTURE,12721,"Every project ﬁnds itself in tension with competing aspirations. How can  the team go fast without compromising quality? How can the team preserve  ﬂexibility while also hitting a ﬁrm date? Most importantly, how does the  team satisfy and meet the requirements of the customer? Project leaders may feel their job is to meet every expectation of every  stakeholder; but, when compelled to make a choice, there is often a priority  depending on the culture and requirements of the organization’s business  environment. For example, a mobile telecom project has a greater bias  for speed, where a government program may have a greater bias for  generalization and stability. “Culture  eats  strategy  for  breakfast” —Peter Drucker This statement stresses the  importance of people’s commitment  and passion for a cause. No matter  what strategy or plan you implement  with your team, its success is  going to be governed by the people  implementing the plan. If the people  who are driving the strategy aren’t  passionate about the change, or  worse, are apathetic about their  job and their organization, then you  stand little chance of implementing  the change. 76    Section 6  To navigate these dynamics, project leaders should take the time to assess where emphasis is most often applied  in the organization. Figure 6-2 illustrates what an assessment might look like. In this example, a project leader initiates  a conversation about organizational priorities with stakeholders, team members, and senior management. Those  priorities are then recorded as positions on a sliding scale between two extremes. The results are then used to ﬁnd agile  techniques that best ﬁt with those priorities. Figure 6-2.

6.3 PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACTS,12772,"As mentioned earlier in this practice guide, the Agile Manifesto values “customer collaboration over contract  negotiation.” Many project failures stem from breakdowns in the customer–supplier relationship. Projects incur more  risk when those involved in the contract take the perspective of winners vs. losers. A collaborative approach is one that  pursues a shared-risk-reward relationship, where all sides win. Some contracting techniques that can formalize this  dynamic include the following: u u Multi-tiered structure. Rather than formalizing an entire contracting relationship in a single document, project  parties can achieve more ﬂexibility by describing different aspects in different documents. Mostly ﬁxed items  (e.g., warranties, arbitration) can be locked in a master agreement. Meanwhile, all parties list other items subject  to change (e.g., services rates, product descriptions) in a schedule of services. The contract can reference them  in the master services agreement. Finally, more dynamic items such as scope, schedule, and budget can be  formalized in a lightweight statement of work. Isolating the more changing elements of a contract into a single  document simpliﬁes modiﬁcations and thus ﬂexibility. u u Emphasize value delivered. Many vendor relationships are governed by ﬁxed milestones or “phase gates”  focused on intermediate artifacts, rather than a full deliverable of incremental business value. Often, these  controls limit the use of feedback to improve the product. Instead, milestones and payment terms can be  structured based on value-driven deliverables in order to enhance the project’s agility. u u Fixed-price increments. Rather than lock an entire project scope and budget into a single agreement, a project  can decompose the scope into ﬁxed-price microdeliverables, such as user stories. For the customer, this gives  more control over how the money is spent. For the supplier, it limits the ﬁnancial risk of over-commitment to a  single feature or deliverable. TIP Culture versus Structure Some people insist new organizational structures be installed before any cultural shift can begin.  Others maintain the opposite—those new organizational structures are only superﬁcial adjustments until  the collective culture moves in a meaningful direction. In reality, one cannot progress without the other.  Project leaders wanting to achieve agility should consider the current and future states of both of these  aspects in their organization. 78    Section 6  u u Not-to-exceed time and materials. Customers incur unwanted risk from a traditional time and materials  approach. One alternative is to limit the overall budget to a ﬁxed amount. This allows the customer to incorporate  new ideas and innovations into the project not originally planned. When customers want to incorporate new  ideas, they will have to manage to a given capacity, replacing original work with new work. Work should be  closely monitored as hours allocated reach their limit. Also, additional contingency hours could be planned into  the maximum budget if considered helpful. u u Graduated time and materials. Another alternative is a shared ﬁnancial risk approach. In agile, the quality criteria  are part of what done means. Therefore, the supplier can be rewarded with a higher hourly rate when delivery is  earlier than the contracted deadline. Conversely, the supplier would suffer a rate reduction for late delivery. u u Early cancellation option. When an agile supplier delivers sufﬁcient value with only half of the scope completed,  the customer should not be bound to pay the remaining half if the customer no longer needs it. Instead, a contract  can offer the customer to buy the remainder of the project for a cancellation fee. The customer limits budget  exposure and the supplier earns positive revenue for services no longer required. u u Dynamic scope option. For those contracts with a ﬁxed budget, a supplier may offer the customer the option  to vary the project scope at speciﬁed points in the project. The customer can adjust features to ﬁt the capacity.  Then the customer can leverage innovation opportunities, while limiting the supplier’s risk of over commitment. u u Team augmentation. Arguably the most collaborative contracting approach is to embed the supplier’s services  directly into the customer organization. Funding teams instead of a speciﬁc scope preserves the customer’s  strategic discretion on what work should actually be done. 79 u u Favor full-service suppliers. In order to diversify risk, customers may seek a multisupplier strategy. However,  the temptation will be to contract the work such that each supplier does only one thing, which creates a web of  dependencies before any usable service or product emerges. Instead, place an emphasis on engagements that  deliver full value (as in the idea of completed independent feature sets). It is possible to create agile contracts. Agile is built on a synergy of collaboration and trust. The supplier can help by  delivering value early and often. The customer can help by providing timely feedback.","As mentioned earlier in this practice guide, the Agile Manifesto values customer collaboration over contract  negotiation.

6.4 BUSINESS PRACTICES,12837,"The willingness and ability to create new competences within an organization when the need arises is a mark of  organizational agility. These do not have to be earth-shattering changes and could be less disruptive in an organization  that is focused on agility and the results it provides. Transparency and open collaboration are absolutely key. As cross-functional teams deliver value, the teams and individuals might encounter problems with various support  functions in the organization. As team delivers value on a regular basis, ﬁnance departments may have the opportunity to capitalize the product  differently. If the team has contracts with other organizations, procurement departments may need to change those  contracts to help the other organizations deliver value frequently and synchronize with the team. Once teams start to work in a cohesive and cooperative manner, they will challenge internal management policies.  Human resources may notice individual incentives make less sense, and managers may struggle with the performance  appraisals of self-organizing employees. In each case, these are opportunities to review the degree to which existing  practices support agile ways of working. As organizations progress to greater agility, there will be obvious needs for additional business units to change the  way they interact and perform their responsibilities.

For this reason, it is  necessary to have an understanding of how agile works within an existing program and portfolio management context."
6.5.1 FRAMEWORKS,12858,"The guidance of the most widespread agile methods such as Scrum and eXtreme Programming focus on the activities  of a single, small, usually colocated, cross-functional team. While this is very useful for efforts that require a single  team, it may provide insufﬁcient guidance for initiatives that require the collaboration of multiple agile teams in a  program or portfolio. A range of frameworks (such as the Scaled Agile Framework, Large Scale Scrum, and Disciplined Agile) and approaches  (e.g., Scrum of Scrums) have emerged to cater to just such circumstances. More details on these can be found in Annex A3.","The guidance of the most widespread agile methods such as Scrum and eXtreme Programming focus on the activities  of a single, small, usually colocated, crossfunctional team.

6.5.2 CONSIDERATIONS,12865,"There is more than one way to scale work. The team might need to scale the work of several agile projects into a  single agile program. Alternatively, the organization can design a structure that supports agile approaches across the  entire portfolio. For example, it is helpful to start small and learn as rapidly as possible what works well in the organizational context.  Teams can achieve successful outcomes even when everything is not completely transformed into an agile approach. Regardless of the approach, a critical success factor is the healthy agile team. If using an agile approach for a single  team is not successful, do not try to scale up to using it more broadly; instead, address the organizational impediments  that prevent teams from working in an agile way. The goal of large-scale agile projects is to coordinate the efforts of different teams to bring value to customers. There  is more than one way to do that. Teams may use a formal framework or apply agile thinking to adjust existing program  management practices. 81","There is more than one way to scale work.

6.6 AGILE AND THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT OFFICE (PMO),12878,"The PMO exists to shepherd business value throughout the organization. It might do this by helping projects achieve  their goals. Sometimes, the PMO educates teams (or arranges for training) and supports projects. Sometimes, the PMO  advises management about the relative business value for a given project or set of projects. Because agile creates cultural change, over time, the organization might need to change, including the PMO. For  example, managers make decisions about which projects to fund and when, and teams decide what they need for  training or advice.","The PMO exists to shepherd business value throughout the organization.

6.6.1 AN AGILE PMO IS VALUE-DRIVEN,12885,"Any project should deliver the right value, to the right audience, at the right time. The PMO’s objective is to facilitate  and enable this goal. An agile-based PMO approach is based on a customer-collaboration mindset and is present in  all PMO programs. In many cases, this means the PMO operates as if it were a consulting business, tailoring its efforts  to meet speciﬁc needs requested by a given project. Some projects may need tools and templates, while others may  beneﬁt from executive coaching. The PMO should strive to deliver what is needed and keep the pulse on its customers  to ensure that it knows and is able to adapt to their needs. This intrapreneur approach focuses on the PMO activities  that are perceived as the most valuable to the projects it supports.","Any project should deliver the right value, to the right audience, at the right time.

6.6.2 AN AGILE PMO IS INVITATION-ORIENTED,12893,"In order to accelerate progress on a value-based charter, a PMO may be tempted to mandate certain solutions or  approaches, for example, to make everyone do it the same way to get some quick wins. However, a more deliberate  perspective incorporates the desire for employee engagement. This is achieved by inviting only those interested to  engage with PMO services. Higher engagement with PMO practices makes it easier for those practices to be “sticky.”  If the PMO is delivering value to its clients, it is more likely that clients will request its services and adopt its practices. 82    Section 6 ","In order to accelerate progress on a valuebased charter, a PMO may be tempted to mandate certain solutions or  approaches, for example, to make everyone do it the same way to get some quick wins.

6.6.3 AN AGILE PMO IS MULTIDISCIPLINARY,12901,"In order to support project-speciﬁc needs, the PMO needs to be conversant in several competencies beyond  project management itself, because different projects require distinct capabilities. For instance, one project may need  organizational design to address stafﬁng challenges while another may require organizational change management  techniques for stakeholder engagement or unique business models to support customer goals. Some organizations have been transforming their PMOs into agile centers of excellence that provide such services as: u u Developing and implementing standards. Provide templates for user stories, test cases, cumulative ﬂow  diagrams, etc. Provide agile tools and educate supporting groups on iterative development concepts. u u Developing personnel through training and mentoring. Coordinate agile training courses, coaches, and  mentors to help people transition to an agile mindset and upgrade their skills. Encourage and support people to  attend local agile events. u u Multiproject management. Coordinate between agile teams by communicating between projects. Consider  sharing items such as progress, issues, and retrospective ﬁndings and improvement experiments. Help  manage major customer releases at the program level and investment themes at the portfolio level using an  appropriate framework. u u Facilitating organizational learning. Gather project velocity proﬁles and capture, store, and index  retrospective ﬁndings. u u Managing stakeholders. Provide product owner training, guidance on acceptance testing, and how to evaluate  and give feedback on systems. Champion the importance of subject matter experts (SMEs) to projects. u u Recruiting, selecting, and evaluating team leaders. Develop guidelines for interviewing agile practitioners. u u Executing specialized tasks for projects. Train and provide retrospective facilitators, create agreements with  agile project troubleshooters, and provide mentors and coaches. 83","In order to support projectspecic needs, the PMO needs to be conversant in several competencies beyond  project management itself, because different projects require distinct capabilities.

6.7 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE,12931,"The structure of an organization strongly inﬂuences its ability to pivot to new information or shifting market needs.  Here is a listing of key characteristics: u u Geography. Geographically distributed and dispersed project organizations may ﬁnd several challenges impeding  their work on any project. Project leaders and regional managers may have alternative or even competing goals.  Additionally, cultural differences, language barriers, and lower visibility can slow down productivity. Fortunately,  the use of agile approaches can encourage more collaboration and conﬁdence than would otherwise exist.  Project leaders in these contexts should encourage dialog at the team and executive level to tailor techniques for  the context and to manage expectations about the effort required to do so. u u Functionalized structures. Some organizations are structured on a spectrum ranging from highly projectized  to matrixed to highly functionalized. Projects with highly functionalized structures may ﬁnd general resistance to  collaboration across its organization. u u Size of project deliverable. Reducing the size of a project deliverable will motivate more frequent handoffs  across departments, and thus more frequent interactions and a faster ﬂow of value across the organization. u u Allocation of people to projects. Another approach is to ask for a single person from each department to be  temporarily, yet fully allocated, to the highest priority project. u u Procurement-heavy organizations. Some organizations choose to implement projects primarily through  vendors. Although project goals may be clear, vendors have a responsibility to look after their own ﬁnancial  viability. Moreover, once vendors complete their obligations and leave the engagement, the associated project  knowledge goes with them. This limits the internal competencies needed for sustained ﬂexibility and speed. Agile  techniques such as retrospectives and follow up on possible improvement areas when the vendor is still engaged  can help mitigate loss of product knowledge.
