"0,1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management,"" The purpose of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  is to ( a  ) provide a standard for project  management practitioners and other stakeholders that deﬁ nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that  are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b  ) provide a standard that is globally  applicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for  training or educational purposes.   The  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  covers risk management as it is applied to single  projects only. Like the  PMBOK  ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs  or portfolios of projects.   Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK  ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition, is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk  Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles  relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards.   Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the  PMBOK  ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition  and textbooks, handbooks, and courses.   Figure 1-1. Hierarchy of PMI Project Risk Management Resources  3 ©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION  This practice standard is organized in three main sections:   1.  Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to  Project Risk Management processes as deﬁ ned in the  PMBOK  ®  Guide – Fourth Edition.   2.  Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth  Edition. The six processes are as follows:   Plan Risk Management,  •   Identify Risks,  •   Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis,  •   Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis,  •   Plan Risk Responses, and  •   Monitor and Control Risks.  •   Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics:  ( a  ) purpose and objectives of the process"; ( b  ) critical success factors for the process; ( c   ) tools and  techniques for the process;" and ( d   ) documenting the results of the process.   3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard.   This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive,  and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for  several reasons:   1.  Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and  techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence.   2.  Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk  Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to  apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is  tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There  are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of  Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard.   3.  The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, reﬂ ecting the many  business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures  between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations,  and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams.   The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can  establish processes speciﬁ c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with  these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.  4 ©2009 Project Management Institute.

"2,1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management,"" Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management.  It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In  this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every  process group.   Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ nal design  and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often  assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of  project risks.   Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it  builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates  and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty.  Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates  and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project.   Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary,  Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and  change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds  the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk  into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and  schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ dence  for meeting project objectives.  5 ©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION  There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of  risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not  mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different  ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the  more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be.   A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life  cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk  management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available  about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and  cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ exibility and  knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop.   It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in  place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced.  During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new  risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing  risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for  the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future.   Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to  contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management  practice.

It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In  this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every  process group.   Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to  nal design  and from procurement through daily management of execution and closeout. These processes often  assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of  project risks.   Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it  builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates  and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty.  Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates  and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project.   Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary,  Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes  be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds  the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk  into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and  schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of con dence  for meeting project objectives.  5 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 1 CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION  There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of  risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not  mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different  ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the  more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be.   A risk management approach is applicable throughout a projects life cycle. The earlier in the project life  cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk  management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available  about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and  cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project  exibility and  knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop.   It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in  place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced.  During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new  risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing  risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for  the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future.   Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, riskrelated lessons are reviewed in order to  contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management  practice.

"3,1.4 Good Risk Management Practice,"" Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of  the other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be  conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other  processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is  appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the  multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture  projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe.   Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may  require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets,  make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of  accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and  external requirements.  6 ©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION  Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project  Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing  with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk  Management beneﬁ ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement  among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identiﬁ cation, analysis, and response,  in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other  unreasonable inﬂ uences.   Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of  tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the  characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large  project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and  attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted  in the background with a ﬂ exible deadline.   Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under  management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions  made in that process remain appropriate.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION  Speciﬁ c criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing  with those processes. The general criteria for success include:    • Recognize the Value of Risk Management    — Project Risk Management should be recognized  as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational  management, project stakeholders (both internal and external), project management, and team  members.    • Individual Commitment/Responsibility    — Project participants and stakeholders should all accept  responsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybody’s  responsibility.    • Open and Honest Communication    — Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management  process.  Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness  of Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making.    • Organizational Commitment    — Organizational commitment can only be established if risk  management is aligned with the organization’s goals and values. Project Risk Management may  require a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because  handling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the  project manager.    • Risk Effort Scaled to Project    — Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value  of the project to the organization and with its level of project risk, its scale, and other organizational  constraints. In particular, the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential  value to the project and the organization.    • Integration with Project Management   — Project Risk Management does not exist in a vacuum,  isolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires  the correct execution of the other project management processes.

"7,2.2 Deﬁ nition of Project Risk,"" The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use  in the  PMBOK  ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process  descriptions. The deﬁ nition of project risk given in the  PMBOK  ®  Guide – Fourth Edition is as follows:    Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative  effect on a project’s objectives.   This deﬁ nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When  assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty  dimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other  descriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”).   The deﬁ nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and  more general conditions which are less speciﬁ c but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The deﬁ nition of project  risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project’s objectives, as  well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and  opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uniﬁ ed Project Risk Management  process. This allows for the gain of synergies and efﬁ ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses  and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.  10 ©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 2 CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS  Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they  did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are  events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise  to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project  objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement  or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3).

Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole.

It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project  outcome. It is an important component of strategic decision-making, program and portfolio management,  and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set.

"9,2.4 Stakeholder Risk Attitudes,"" The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall  project risk matters. A wide range of factors inﬂ uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project  within the range of stakeholders’ overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the  performance of the project, and the stakeholders’ sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts,  industrial relations, and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased  certainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk  is regarded is usually also strongly inﬂ uenced by an organization’s culture.

"14,3.1 Project Risk Management and Project Management,"" All projects are uncertain. Uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings  based on assumptions and constraints, delivering project results to multiple stakeholders with different  requirements. Project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment, through  the use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating, planning, cost control, task allocation,  earned value analysis, monitoring and review meetings, etc. Each of these elements of project management  has a role in deﬁ ning or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects.

"15,3.2 Project Risk Management Processes,"" The deﬁ ned steps of Project Risk Management describe a structured approach for understanding and  managing risk on a project. This chapter outlines the steps required for effective Project Risk Management.  Each step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters.   As previously deﬁ ned, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or  negative effect on a project’s objectives. From this deﬁ nition, it is clear that risks only exist in relation to  objectives. It is therefore essential at the start of the Project Risk Management process to clearly deﬁ ne the  objectives. It is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk, so each step in the  Project Risk Management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk. Scalable elements  of the process include:   Available resources,  •   Methodology and processes used,  •   Tools and techniques used,  •   Supporting infrastructure,  •   Review and update frequency, and  •   Reporting requirements.  •   As a precondition for a successful Project Risk Management implementation, it is important to have a clear  understanding of the risk thresholds that deﬁ ne the key stakeholders’ views on acceptable levels of risk, as  well as a framework against which identiﬁ ed risks can be assessed.   As a result, the Project Risk Management process always starts with an initiation step. This is required in  order to ensure a common understanding and agreement of the team and other stakeholders on the approach  and parameters that will be applied in managing risk in this project, as well as the scope and objectives of the  Project Risk Management process itself. Project Risk Management activities, resources, and attention should  be appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application.  The main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows:   Deﬁ ne those objectives against which risks will be identiﬁ ed,  •   Deﬁ ne how the elements of the Project Risk Management process will be scaled for this  •  project, and   Deﬁ ne risk thresholds, tolerances, and the assessment framework.  •   The outputs from this initial step should be documented, communicated, and then reviewed by the  stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the scope and objectives for the Project Risk Management  process. The document should be formally approved at a senior level.  15 ©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 3 CHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  Once the Project Risk Management scope and objectives are agreed upon, it is possible to start identifying  risks, being careful to distinguish genuine risks from non-risks (such as causes, effects, problems, issues etc.).  A variety of risk identiﬁ cation techniques is available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One or  more techniques should be selected as appropriate for meeting the needs of the speciﬁ c project. The aim is  to expose and document all knowable risks, recognizing that some risks will be inherently unknowable and  others will emerge later in the project. The emergent nature of risk requires the Project Risk Management  process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process in order to ﬁ nd risks which were not evident earlier  in the project. Input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders when identifying risks, since  each will have a different perspective on the risks facing the project. Historical records and project documents  should also be reviewed to identify risks for this project.   All identiﬁ ed risks are recorded. Ideally, a risk owner is designated for each identiﬁ ed risk. It is the  responsibility of the risk owner to manage the corresponding risk through all of the subsequent Project Risk  Management processes.   Following risk identiﬁ cation, it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each risk, in order to prioritize  individual risks for further attention, evaluate the level of overall project risk, and determine appropriate  responses. Risk evaluation can be performed using qualitative techniques to address individual risks, using  quantitative techniques to consider the overall effect of risk on the project outcome, or using both in combination.  These two approaches require different types of data, but where both qualitative and quantitative techniques  are used, an integrated approach should be adopted.   Qualitative techniques are used to gain a better understanding of individual risks, considering a range  of characteristics such as probability of occurrence, degree of impact on project objectives, manageability,  timing of possible impacts, relationships with other risks, common causes or effects, etc. Understanding and  prioritizing risks is an essential prerequisite to managing them, so qualitative techniques are used on most  projects. The outputs from qualitative assessments should be documented and communicated to key project  stakeholders and form a basis for determining appropriate responses.   Quantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identiﬁ ed risks on the project outcome.  These techniques take into account probabilistic or project-wide effects, such as correlation between risks,  interdependency, and feedback loops, thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The  result is an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The results of quantitative analysis  should be used to focus the development of appropriate responses, particularly the calculation of required  contingency reserve levels, and must be documented and communicated to inform subsequent actions.  Quantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk.  16 ©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 3 CHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  Once individual risks have been prioritized and the degree of overall project risk exposure is understood,  appropriate risk responses should be developed using an iterative process which continues until an optimal  set of responses has been developed. A range of possible response strategies exists for both threats and  opportunities. The risk owner should select a suitable strategy for each individual risk, based on its characteristics  and assessed priority, ensuring that the strategy is achievable, affordable, cost effective, and appropriate. The  use of a single strategy that addresses several related risks should be considered whenever possible. The risk  owner is responsible for deﬁ ning actions to implement the chosen strategy. These actions may be delegated to  action owners as appropriate. The risk owner should monitor actions to determine their effectiveness, and also  to identify any secondary risks which may arise because of the implementation of risk responses. In addition  to individual risk responses, actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk. All response strategies  and actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the  project plan.   It is essential that agreed-upon actions are implemented";" otherwise the risk exposure of the project remains  unchanged. It is also vital that the Project Risk Management process be repeated at regular intervals throughout  the life of the project. This will enable the project team to reevaluate the status of previously identiﬁ ed risks,  to identify emergent and secondary risks, and to determine the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management  process.   The steps outlined previously form the Project Risk Management process. These are detailed in subsequent  chapters, as follows:    • Plan Risk Management (Chapter 4)  — Deﬁ nes the scope and objectives of the Project Risk  Management process, and ensures that the risk process is fully integrated into wider project  management.    • Identify Risks (Chapter 5) —  Identiﬁ es as many knowable risks as practicable.    • Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis (Chapter 6)  — Evaluates key characteristics of individual risks  enabling them to be prioritized for further action.    • Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis (Chapter 7)  — Evaluates the combined effect of risks on the  overall project outcome.    • Plan Risk Responses (Chapter 8)  — Determines appropriate response strategies and actions for  each individual risk and for overall project risk, and integrates them into a consolidated project  management plan.    • Monitor and Control Risks (Chapter 9)  — Implements agreed-upon actions, reviews changes in  project risk exposure, identiﬁ es additional risk management actions as required, and assesses the  effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process.

This chapter outlines the steps required for effective Project Risk Management.  Each step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters.   As previously de ned, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or  negative effect on a projects objectives. From this de nition, it is clear that risks only exist in relation to  objectives. It is therefore essential at the start of the Project Risk Management process to clearly de ne the  objectives. It is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk, so each step in the  Project Risk Management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk. Scalable elements  of the process include:   Available resources,     Methodology and processes used,     Tools and techniques used,     Supporting infrastructure,     Review and update frequency, and     Reporting requirements.     As a precondition for a successful Project Risk Management implementation, it is important to have a clear  understanding of the risk thresholds that de ne the key stakeholders views on acceptable levels of risk, as  well as a framework against which identi ed risks can be assessed.   As a result, the Project Risk Management process always starts with an initiation step.

A variety of risk identi cation techniques is available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One or  more techniques should be selected as appropriate for meeting the needs of the speci c project. The aim is  to expose and document all knowable risks, recognizing that some risks will be inherently unknowable and  others will emerge later in the project. The emergent nature of risk requires the Project Risk Management  process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process in order to  nd risks which were not evident earlier  in the project. Input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders when identifying risks, since  each will have a different perspective on the risks facing the project. Historical records and project documents  should also be reviewed to identify risks for this project.   All identi ed risks are recorded. Ideally, a risk owner is designated for each identi ed risk. It is the  responsibility of the risk owner to manage the corresponding risk through all of the subsequent Project Risk  Management processes.   Following risk identi cation, it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each risk, in order to prioritize  individual risks for further attention, evaluate the level of overall project risk, and determine appropriate  responses. Risk evaluation can be performed using qualitative techniques to address individual risks, using  quantitative techniques to consider the overall effect of risk on the project outcome, or using both in combination.  These two approaches require different types of data, but where both qualitative and quantitative techniques  are used, an integrated approach should be adopted.   Qualitative techniques are used to gain a better understanding of individual risks, considering a range  of characteristics such as probability of occurrence, degree of impact on project objectives, manageability,  timing of possible impacts, relationships with other risks, common causes or effects, etc. Understanding and  prioritizing risks is an essential prerequisite to managing them, so qualitative techniques are used on most  projects. The outputs from qualitative assessments should be documented and communicated to key project  stakeholders and form a basis for determining appropriate responses.   Quantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identi ed risks on the project outcome.  These techniques take into account probabilistic or projectwide effects, such as correlation between risks,  interdependency, and feedback loops, thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The  result is an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The results of quantitative analysis  should be used to focus the development of appropriate responses, particularly the calculation of required  contingency reserve levels, and must be documented and communicated to inform subsequent actions.  Quantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk.  16 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 3 CHAPTER 3  INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  Once individual risks have been prioritized and the degree of overall project risk exposure is understood,  appropriate risk responses should be developed using an iterative process which continues until an optimal  set of responses has been developed. A range of possible response strategies exists for both threats and  opportunities. The risk owner should select a suitable strategy for each individual risk, based on its characteristics  and assessed priority, ensuring that the strategy is achievable, affordable, cost effective, and appropriate. The  use of a single strategy that addresses several related risks should be considered whenever possible. The risk  owner is responsible for de ning actions to implement the chosen strategy. These actions may be delegated to  action owners as appropriate. The risk owner should monitor actions to determine their effectiveness, and also  to identify any secondary risks which may arise because of the implementation of risk responses. In addition  to individual risk responses, actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk. All response strategies  and actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the  project plan.   It is essential that agreedupon actions are implemented";" otherwise the risk exposure of the project remains  unchanged. It is also vital that the Project Risk Management process be repeated at regular intervals throughout  the life of the project.

"16,4.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Management Process,"" The objectives of the Plan Risk Management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy  for the project, to decide how the risk management processes will be executed, and to integrate Project Risk  Management with all other project management activities.   Effective risk management requires creation of a risk management plan. This plan describes how the  risk management processes should be carried out and how they ﬁ t in with the other project management  processes. On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management, general project  management, and the management processes in the rest of the organization. To provide the greatest beneﬁ t,  initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the  corresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan. The risk  management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders  become clearer or change.   Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management  plan, a budget in terms of resources, cost, and time for the speciﬁ c risk management activities should be  established in order to better track, control, and, as necessary, defend the corresponding expenditures  throughout the project. The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project  budget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated,  allocated, and managed. The risk management plan will deﬁ ne the monitoring methods to ensure that the  corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately, as well as the conditions under which the approved  budget for risk management can be modiﬁ ed.   In the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration, risk management  activities need to be repeated throughout the project. The risk management plan should deﬁ ne both the  normal frequency for repeating the processes as well as speciﬁ c or exceptional conditions under which the  corresponding actions should be initiated. The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated  into the project management plan.   There are two categories of success criteria for risk management: those for success of the project in  general, and those for success of Project Risk Management.  20 4 ©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management CHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT   • Project-Related Criteria.  To assess the success of Project Risk Management, the stakeholders  must agree on an acceptable level of results for the project-related criteria (such as cost, time, and  scope). In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders, the risk management  plan should present these objectives with reference to the project deﬁ nition documents. To provide  guidance in risk management, particularly in prioritizing risk responses, stakeholders should also  prioritize each project objective.    • Process-Related Criteria.  The measures for success in Project Risk Management depend on a  number of factors, such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project. For example, the Project  Risk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than  for a project with a more predictable environment. A research Project Risk Management process  may be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be  allowable for a successful process in a more predictable project.   The level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant  stakeholders. The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be inﬂ uenced by a number  of factors, all of which need to be identiﬁ ed. These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty, and the  relative importance to them of achieving or missing speciﬁ c project objectives. The output of this analysis  should then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the  Project Risk Management processes in the speciﬁ c project.   Guidelines and rules for escalating risk-related information to management and other stakeholders should  reﬂ ect the risk attitudes and expectations of the corresponding stakeholders. The project manager should  maintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves, in order to become aware of  any changes in the stakeholders’ attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts  into account.   It is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks,  and that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be deﬁ ned in a  manner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders. If qualitative analysis  uses such terms as “high impact” or “medium probability,” these should be deﬁ ned objectively in the risk  management plan. Similarly, the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in  quantitative analysis or for decision-making in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control.   Risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a  template of the risk register that will be used for recording risk-related information. The risk management plan  should also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management  processes should be applied";" this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the speciﬁ ed risk  management objectives.   In order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively, the project  team and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate, their criteria  for determining success, their level of authority, and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond  this level. The risk management plan speciﬁ es the project’s risk management roles and responsibilities and  deﬁ nes the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel.  21 ©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 4 CHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT  Risk-related communication occurs at two levels: (a) within the project team, and (b) between the project  team and the other project stakeholders. The principles for each of these categories of communication are  deﬁ ned in the risk management plan. For the team, the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various  risk management meetings and reports required to carry out the corresponding Project Risk Management  processes as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports. For the other stakeholders, the  plan sets their expectations as to the structure, content, and frequency of routine documents to be received  as well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events. Details of the  information required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly deﬁ ned.

"42,6.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Qualitative Risk,""Analysis Process   The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually  identiﬁ ed project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreed-upon characteristics.   Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur  and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives. As such it does not directly address the overall  risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with  each other.

If several risks arise  from a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus  on addressing this root cause.   Identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identiﬁ cation of the areas of greatest risk exposure  (e.g. to the project completion date, the budget, or a particular deliverable’s scope), facilitating risk response  focus in these areas.   The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify  Risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most inﬂ uence  (positive or negative) on achieving the project’s objectives.

"44,6.2.1 Use Agreed-Upon Approach,"" The process is based on an agreed-upon approach to this assessment that is applied across all of the  identiﬁ ed risks in any project. By the nature of project risk, all risks may be assessed according to probability  of occurrence and impact on individual objectives should the risk occur. Other factors may be considered in  determining the importance of a risk as follows:    •  Urgency (proximity).  Risks requiring near term responses may be considered more urgent to  address. Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the  clarity of symptoms and warning signs (also known as detectability) that may trigger the response.   Manageability. •    Some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to  address them.

It is generally accepted that analyzing uncertainty in the project using quantitative techniques such as  Monte Carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule  than a non-probabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or line-item cost estimates are  deterministic. However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate  for all projects. For example, qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of  effective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process,  the beneﬁ ts of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the  additional insights and value justify the additional effort.   Partial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time  and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously.  Calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.   Speciﬁ c project risks are usually best understood and quantiﬁ ed at a detailed level such as the line-item  cost or schedule activity level. By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the project’s budget or  the schedule are speciﬁ ed at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such  as one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quantiﬁ ed risks on project objectives.  The implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires:    Complete and accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project  •  elements. Examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate.    Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or line-item costs at a  •  level of detail that lends itself to speciﬁ c assessment of individual risks.   Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements.  •    Applying a quantitative method (such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis) that incorporates  •  multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective.  38 ©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 7 CHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS  Results of the quantitative analysis will be compared to the project plan (baseline or current) to give  management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as:   What is the probability of meeting the project’s objectives?  •    How much contingency reserve (e.g., reserves or buffers of time, resources, and cost) is needed to  •  provide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance?    What are those parts of the project, such as line-item costs or schedule activities, which contribute  •  the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously?   Which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk?  •   Estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quantiﬁ ed  risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders, from those for which the objectives are  within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered. The former may be targeted for vigorous risk  responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders.

"72,8.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Responses Process,"" The objective of the Plan Risk Responses process is to determine the set of actions which most enhance the  chances of project success while complying with applicable organizational and project constraints.   Once risks have been identiﬁ ed, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every  risk the project team considers to be sufﬁ ciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project  objectives or the opportunity it offers. The planning entails agreeing upon the actions to be taken and the  potential changes to budget, schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause.   Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason, the response  speciﬁ cation for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions.   The responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should  be clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process,  and each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a speciﬁ c risk action owner. The risk  owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses  if required, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are  carried out as planned, in a timely manner. The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be  assigned to a single person.   Responses, when implemented, can have potential effects on the project objectives and, as such, can  generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the  same way as those risks which were initially identiﬁ ed.   It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly, there is also a limit  to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed.

"97,9.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Monitor and Control Risks Process,"" The primary objectives of risk monitoring and controlling are to track identiﬁ ed risks, monitor residual risks,  identify new risks, ensure that risk response plans are executed at the appropriate time, and evaluate their  effectiveness throughout the project life cycle.   In addition to tracking and managing the risk response actions, the effectiveness of all of the Project  Risk Management processes should be reviewed to provide improvements to the management of the current  project as well as future ones.   For each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been deﬁ ned, the corresponding set of  trigger conditions should have been speciﬁ ed. It is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these  conditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as deﬁ ned, in a timely  manner.   Once the Plan Risk Responses process is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions  should have been included and deﬁ ned in the current project management plan. The ﬁ rst action of risk  monitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary,  such as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions. This will then ensure  that the agreed-upon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework.   The risk owners and risk action owners need to be briefed on any changes that may affect their  responsibilities. Effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager so  that the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of speciﬁ c risks,  apply their best efforts to track the associated trigger conditions and carry out the agreed-upon responses in  a timely manner.   In addition to the response actions and trigger conditions, a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness  of the response is provided by the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk action owner should keep the risk  owner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been  effectively dealt with, or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented.  52 ©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 9 CHAPTER 9 − MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS  As the project progresses, additional information becomes available and the project environment may  change as some risks occur, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and others become or cease to be relevant.  The planning should therefore be kept current and the project manager should ensure that periodic risk  reassessment, including risk identiﬁ cation, analysis, and response planning, is repeated at reasonable intervals,  or in response to project events—without generating excessive administrative overhead. Typical reasons for  risk reassessment are:   Occurrence of a major or unexpected risk,  •   Need to analyze a complex change request,  •   Phase end review,  •   Project re-planning or major plan elaboration, and  •   Periodic review to ensure that the information remains current.  •   In the event of major organizational changes, risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to  reassessing the risks.   In addition to the regular status reviews, periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and  weaknesses in handling risks within the project. This should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or  keys to success in risk management, recognition of which could lead to improvements in risk management of  the current or future projects.   At the end of the project, an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out  with a focus on long-term process improvements. This analysis consolidates the ﬁ ndings of the periodic  audits to identify lessons that would be applicable in general to a large proportion of the organization’s  projects in the future, such as appropriate levels of resources, adequate time for the analysis, use of tools,  level of detail, etc.   At project closure, the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure of  every risk in the risk register, for example: (a) did not occur"; (b) occurred and contingency plan invoked;" or (c)  occurred and impact to the project scope (i.e., time, cost, and quality).   The output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with speciﬁ c information  with respect to the project’s experience of risks, and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization  should be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them. This can lead to an update to the  corresponding organizational process assets.

"108,A.1  Introduction,"" A PMI practice standard is characterized as follows:    Each practice standard provides guidelines on the mechanics (e.g., nuts and bolts, basics,  •  fundamentals, step-by-step usage guide, how it operates, how to do it) of some signiﬁ cant process  (input, tool, technique, or output) that is relevant to a project manager.    A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the life-cycle phases of many projects";" however, an  •  individual practice standard may be applicable to the completion of one or more phases within a  project.    A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the Knowledge Areas within   •  A Guide to the Project  Management Body of Knowledge ( PMBOK ®  Guide –Fourth Edition), although an individual practice  standard will provide sufﬁ cient detail and background for one or more of the inputs, tools and  techniques, and/or outputs. Therefore, practice standards are not required to use the name of any  Knowledge Area.    Each practice standard should include information on what the signiﬁ cant process is and does,  •  why it is signiﬁ cant, how to perform it, when it should be performed, and, if necessary for further  clariﬁ cation, who should perform it.    Each practice standard should include information that is accepted and applicable for most projects  •  most of the time within the project management community.

"149,D.3.1.1 Estimating Techniques Applied to Probability and Impact,"" The probability of a risk occurring can be speciﬁ ed in several different ways. One common way is to assign  levels of risk probability by ranges of probability. One beneﬁ t of this approach is that the subject matter experts  only need to assess a risk’s probability within a range rather than as a speciﬁ c value. An example, assuming  that a 5×5 Probability and Impact Matrix is desired, is shown in Figure D11 where the probability ranges are  more tightly deﬁ ned at low levels of probability.   Examples of impact level deﬁ nitions are very project-speciﬁ c. The values used to specify the level of impact  from very low to very high (if a 5×5 matrix is being used) should be:    Higher impact, for threats or opportunities, as they move from very low to very high for a speciﬁ c  •  objective    Levels are deﬁ ned by the organization as causing the same amount of pain or gain to the project for  •  each level across objectives    If a risk’s possible impact is uncertain and could be assigned to more than one level of impact (e.g.  •  from moderate to high) the analyst may choose to assign the risk to the impact level that represents  the expected or average impact. Alternatively, the risk may be ﬂ agged for extra analysis in order to  reduce the range of uncertainty to ﬁ t within a single range.   An example of impact level deﬁ nitions is shown in Figure D11. These deﬁ nitions should be tailored or scaled  by stakeholders to the speciﬁ c project. The deﬁ nitions, appropriately tailored to the project, can be used for  opportunities and threats.  Table D3.

What is the relative weighting of the  projects objectives in terms of their priority to the stakeholders or to management? The results are weights   that re ect the relative priority of each objective. This prioritization can be important in  determining how tradeoffs affecting different objectives   will be decided. It can also be used to create an overall project risk priority list from risks that have been  assessed on their implications for individual objectives. Specialized software implementing AHP is available. A  spreadsheet implementation is shown below.   Figure D13.

"162,D.5.1.2 Contingency Reserve Estimation,"" All of the conditional response plans, as well any of the residual risks will, if they occur, have an effect on the  schedule and/or budget and/or performance objectives of the project. An amount (time and cost) needs to be  set aside to allow for these eventualities. This amount is made up of two components: those to cover speciﬁ c,  approved conditional responses (e.g. contingency plans), and those to address unspeciﬁ ed or passively accepted  risks.
