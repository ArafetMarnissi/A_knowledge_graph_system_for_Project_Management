       "This edition of the PMBOK® Guide focuses on delivering outcomes regardless of the approach \n",

       "some level of understanding of how to deliver projects.\n",
       "This edition is very different from the inputs, tools/techniques, and outputs (ITTOs) from \n",
       "previous editions of the PMBOK® Guide. In the previous editions, the ITTOs supported implementation \n",
       "of various processes used in project management. The shift from a process-based standard to one \n",
       "based on principles necessitates a different approach for thinking about the various aspects of \n",
       "project management. Thus, the project performance domains represent a group of related activities \n",
       "that are critical for the effective delivery of project outcomes. There are eight project performance \n",
       "domains in this guide.\n",
       "Tailoring is the deliberate adaptation of the project management approach, governance, \n",
       "and processes to make them more suitable for the given environment and the work at hand. The \n",
       "tailoring process is driven by the guiding project management principles, organizational values, and \n",
       "organizational culture.\n",
       "In embracing the full spectrum of project approaches, this edition of the PMBOK® Guide \n",
       "recognizes that no publication can capture every tool, technique, or practice that project teams \n",
       "might use. Therefore, this edition presents an array of commonly used models, methods, and \n",
       "artifacts that project practitioners can use to accomplish their work.\n",

       "reduced morale and motivation. The model based on work by Ken Thomas and Ralph Kilmann \n",
       "describes six ways of addressing conflict by focusing on the relative power between the individuals \n",

       "Confronting/problem solving. Confronting a conflict treats the conflict as a problem to\n",

       "▶\t\n",
       "Collaborating. Collaborating involves incorporating multiple views about the conflict.\n",
       "The objective is to learn about the various views and see things from multiple perspectives.\n",
       "This is an effective method when there is trust among the participants and when there is\n",

       "As early as 2012, research suggested a move away from a prescriptive, process-oriented standard \n",
       "toward one that requires reflection to apply in practice. Since that time, many of PMI’s standards have \n",
       "moved to a principle-based format, such as The Standard for Program Management – Third Edition \n",
       "and The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition. In addition, as part of supporting the \n",

       "selected for the Development Team and approximately 70 were selected to participate in one of \n",
       "two review teams. The Development Team and review teams were comprised of stakeholders from \n",
       "around the globe and across industry segments and roles (e.g., government, practitioners, academic, \n",
       "consulting, and organizational providers). The teams included expertise in delivering projects using \n",

       "standards2 as well as research on benefits realization management and organizational agility. The \n",
       "content is presented with a focus on delivering value and is inclusive of the various ways in which \n",
       "value is created.\n",
       "The Project Management Principles section evolved throughout the development and validation \n",
       "process. The initial concepts for the principles were identified through the research discussed \n",
       "previously. The Development Team worked individually and collaboratively to identify potential \n",
       "principles and then grouped them into affinity categories. Each category was further analyzed and \n",
       "decomposed to include a list of keywords associated with each category. The potential categories and \n",
       "keywords were composed into an initial draft, which was then reviewed and commented on by the \n",
       "entire Development Team to ensure the intent of the principles was reflected in the draft.\n",
       "It is important to note that the principles are intended to be broadly based. Nothing in the \n",
       "principles is intended to be dogmatic, restrictive, or prescriptive. The principles are aligned with, \n",
       "but not duplicative of, the content in the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.\n",
       "It is not possible to generate the “right principles” as each project and organization is different. \n",
       "Therefore, the principles are designed as a guide for people working on projects. Project professionals \n",

       "were integrated, the Development Team and Review Team 1 reviewed and commented on the drafts \n",
       "of each section of the standard. These reviews produced over a thousand comments which the \n",

       "The draft standard was made available for public review and comment from 15 January to \n",
       "14 February 2020. Almost 600 individuals submitted comments on the exposure draft. In response \n",
       "to the exposure draft comments, the content was reorganized and edited for clarity. Most comments \n",
