# A_knowledge_graph_system_for_Project_Management
🌟 Revolutionizing Project Management with a Graph-Based Recommendation System! 🌟

I'm excited to share our latest project: an advanced Graph Knowledge System designed to enhance risk management, analysis, and decision-making in project management. 🚀

🔑 Project Highlights:

Purpose: Providing innovative solutions for improved project insights, risk mitigation, and strategic decision-making.
Core Features:
  - Data Extraction: A knowledge graph enriched with information from PMI Standards, PMBOK 6 & 7, Glossary of Risk Management, and real-world case studies.
    
  - Dual Recommendation Systems:
    1-BERT-Based System: Utilizes BERT embeddings with a custom link predictor model for tailored recommendations.
    2-BERT + RGCN-Based System: Combines BERT embeddings and RGCN for enhanced embeddings, refined by a customized link predictor model for superior results.
    
  - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Integrated RGCN for robust embeddings and advanced link prediction powering intelligent recommendations.
💡 Technologies Used:
PyTorch, RGCN, Link Prediction Models, BERT, GPT-4 Mini, and Pinecone for indexing and retrieval.

🤝 Collaboration & Guidance:
This project was a collective effort by Saif Zribi, Aziz Ben Romdhane, Hoossem Eddine Mars, and Jasser Chtourou.

🔍 Impact:
Empowering project managers with actionable insights and tailored recommendations for making informed, data-driven decisions in complex environments.

We're proud of the groundbreaking solutions we've developed and look forward to exploring their real-world applications! 🌐
