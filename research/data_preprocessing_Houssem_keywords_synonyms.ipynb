            "2.   Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk\n",
            "Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to\n",
            "apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is\n",

            "Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary,\n",
            "Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and\n",

            "The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use\n",
            "in the   PMBOK    ®    Guide   – Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process\n",
            "descriptions. The deﬁ nition of project risk given in the   PMBOK    ®    Guide  – Fourth Edition is as follows:\n",
            "Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative\n",
            "effect on a project’s objectives.\n",
            "This deﬁ nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When\n",
            "assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty\n",
            "dimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other\n",
            "descriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”).\n",
            "The deﬁ nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and\n",
            "more general conditions which are less speciﬁ c but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The deﬁ nition of project\n",
            "risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project’s objectives, as\n",
            "well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and\n",
            "opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uniﬁ ed Project Risk Management\n",
            "process. This allows for the gain of synergies and efﬁ ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses\n",
            "and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.\n",
            "Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they\n",
            "did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are\n",
            "events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise\n",
            "to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project\n",
            "objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement\n",
            "or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3).\n",
            "When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or\n",

            "elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project\n",

            "The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use\n",
            "in the   PMBOK    ®    Guide   – Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process\n",
            "descriptions. The deﬁ nition of project risk given in the   PMBOK    ®    Guide  – Fourth Edition is as follows:\n",
            "Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative\n",
            "effect on a project’s objectives.\n",
            "This deﬁ nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When\n",
            "assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty\n",
            "dimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other\n",
            "descriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”).\n",
            "The deﬁ nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and\n",
            "more general conditions which are less speciﬁ c but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The deﬁ nition of project\n",
            "risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project’s objectives, as\n",
            "well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and\n",
            "opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uniﬁ ed Project Risk Management\n",
            "process. This allows for the gain of synergies and efﬁ ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses\n",
            "and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.\n",
            "Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they\n",
            "did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are\n",
            "events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise\n",
            "to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project\n",
            "objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement\n",
            "or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3).\n",
            "When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or\n",
            "problems; opportunities which occur may be called beneﬁ ts. Both issues/problems and beneﬁ ts entail project\n",

            "may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding\n",

This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. The   Practice Standard for Project Risk Management   covers risk management as it is applied to single projects only. Like the   PMBOK    \\u00ae    Guide   \\u2013 Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects. Chapter 11 of the   PMBOK    \\u00ae    Guide \\u2013   Fourth Edition, is the basis for the   Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. and textbooks, handbooks, and courses. This practice standard is organized in three main sections: 1.   Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to Project Risk Management processes as de\\ufb01 ned in the   PMBOK    \\u00ae    Guide  \\u2013 Fourth Edition. 2.   Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the   PMBOK     \\u00ae    Guide   \\u2013 Fourth Edition. The six processes are as follows: Plan Risk Management, Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, Plan Risk Responses, and Monitor and Control Risks. Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: (  a   ) purpose and objectives of the process; (  b   ) critical success factors for the process; (  c    ) tools and techniques for the process; and (  d    ) documenting the results of the process. 3.  A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons: 1.   Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. 2.   Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. 3.   The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, re\\ufb02 ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures between commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization\\u2019s processes. Practitioners can establish processes speci\\ufb01 c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice. \",\n          \"6.3  Tools and Techniques for the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process The tools and techniques used for assessing individual risks will identify the risks that are important to the 6.3.1 Select Risk Characteristics that De\\ufb01 ne Risks\\u2019 Importance Qualitative risk analysis tools provide ways to distinguish those risks that are important for response or further analysis from those that are less important. The criteria that make a risk of interest to management are agreed upon in advance and implemented in the tools used. Output from qualitative risk analysis tools includes a listing of risks in priority order or in priority groups (e.g., high, moderate, and low). The tools for qualitative risk analysis allow the organization or project stakeholders to specify those levels or combinations of risk characteristics that make a particular risk of interest to management. Most tools assess a risk\\u2019s importance from a combination of probability of occurrence and degree of impact on objectives. 6.3.2 Collect and Analyze Data Assessment of individual risks is based on information collected about them. Therefore, data collection and evaluation tools, including interviews, workshops, and references to databases of prior projects, require management support and attention. It is important to protect against bias in data gathering, which is important when relying on expert judgment for the information. 6.3.3 Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Speci\\ufb01 c Objectives Some tools permit distinguishing a risk\\u2019s priority in terms of the affected objective. This capability provides a list of risks that are important for any speci\\ufb01 c objective of interest to management. This is useful since it is common for risks to have uneven impacts on various project objectives. 6.3.4 Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Overall Project There are reasons for constructing a measure of a speci\\ufb01 c risk\\u2019s importance to the entire project as contrasted with its importance to speci\\ufb01 c objectives. A common reason is for ease of communication with management and other stakeholders. When a single risk prioritization index is needed, the organization should be explicit about how that index is created. Usually the index re\\ufb02 ects the organization\\u2019s preference among objectives. The technique for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented in the Plan Risk Management process. 6.3.5 Categorize Risk Causes Categorizing risks appropriately may lead to improved analysis of the probability and magnitude of project risk and to effective responses. Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better understanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate and independent events. Identifying common root causes of a group of risks, for instance, may reveal both the magnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several risks simultaneously. Alternatively, some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain, and understanding the chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project. Identifying risks that can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of problems of risk mitigation using scarce resources. Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure (see Identify Risks, Chapter 5) can show clusters of priority risks arising from speci\\ufb01 c sources. A combination of the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure (WBS) can show which areas of the project exhibit the most risk. Assessing the high-priority risks\\u2019 impact on one objective, such as the schedule, may indicate which activities to address to reduce that objective\\u2019s uncertainty. All of these approaches can contribute to the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis. 6.3.6 Document the Results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks (see Identify Risks, Chapter 5) into categories of priority. Priorities are usually based on the risk\\u2019s probability of occurring and its potential impact on speci\\ufb01 c project objectives or on the whole project. Each identi\\ufb01 ed risk is assigned a priority, perhaps by objective or for the entire project. This information is usually stored in the risk register which is easy to use and update with new information. The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the project participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan. Risks that are judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally monitored frequently. Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less often for changes in their status. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":
