Gteborg May Ewelina Gajewska Mikaela Ropel Introduction Risk management RM concept used industries related business automobile pharmaceutical industry construction sector industry developed RM standards general ideas concept usually remain regardless sector According Project Management Institute PMI project risk management one nine critical parts project commissioning indicates strong relationship managing risks project success RM described difficult area within construction management Winch Potts application promoted projects order avoid negative consequences Potts One concept widely used within field RM called risk management process RMP consists four main steps identification assessment taking action monitoring risks Cooper et al steps number methods techniques facilitate handling risks Many industries become proactive aware using analyses projects Likewise RM become timely issue widely discussed across industries However regard construction industry risk management commonly used Klemetti construction companies starting become aware RMP still using models techniques aimed managing risks contradicts fact industry trying cost time efficient well control projects Risk associated project regardless industry thus RM interest project manager Risks differ projects due fact every project unique especially construction industry Gould Joyce However still many practitioners realized importance including risk management process delivering project Smith et al Even though awareness risks consequences organizations approach established RM methods construction industry operates uncertain environment conditions change due complexity project Sanvido et al aim organization successful RM facilitate However underlined risk management tool ensures success rather tool helps increase probability achieving success Risk management therefore proactive rather reactive concept Many previous studies Klemetti Lyons Skitmore Zou et al conducted within field RM presents different approach concept research master thesis focuses construction industry subject practiced everyday operation concept RM presented systematized project life cycle PLC approach show differences
