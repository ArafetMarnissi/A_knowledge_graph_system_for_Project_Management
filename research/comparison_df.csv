" The purpose of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  is to  provide a standard for project  management practitioners and other stakeholders that de nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that  are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and  provide a standard that is globally  applicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for  training or educational purposes.   The  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  covers risk management as it is applied to single  projects only. Like the  PMBOK    Guide   Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs  or portfolios of projects.   Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK    Guide   Fourth Edition, is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk  Management . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles  relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards.   Figure 11 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the  PMBOK    Guide   Fourth Edition  and textbooks, handbooks, and courses.   Figure 11. Hierarchy of PMI Project Risk Management Resources  3 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 1 CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION  This practice standard is organized in three main sections:   1.  Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to  Project Risk Management processes as de ned in the  PMBOK    Guide  Fourth Edition.   2.  Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK     Guide   Fourth  Edition. The six processes are as follows:   Plan Risk Management,     Identify Risks,     Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis,     Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis,     Plan Risk Responses, and     Monitor and Control Risks.     Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics:   purpose and objectives of the process;  critical success factors for the process;  tools and  techniques for the process; and  documenting the results of the process.   3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard.   This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive,  and successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for  several reasons:   1.  Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and  techniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence.   2.  Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk  Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to  apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is  tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There  are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of  Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard.   3.  The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, re ecting the many  business and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures  between commercial and national companies, government and nongovernment organizations,  and the crosscultural environment often found on these project teams.   The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organizations processes. Practitioners can  establish processes speci c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with  these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.  4 2009 Project Management Institute.

" The de nition of Project Risk Management, as de ned in the  PMBOK    Guide   Fourth Edition, is the basis  for this practice standard: Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting  risk management planning, identi cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project. The   PMBOK    Guide   Fourth Edition also states: The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the  probability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the  project. In the  PMBOK    Guide   Fourth Edition, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs,  has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives. Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost,  and quality.   Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide  actionoriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may  or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to  other dimensions such as their impact on objectives. ","project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives. project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives."
" Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management.  It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In  this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every  process group.   Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to  nal design  and from procurement through daily management of execution and closeout. These processes often  assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of  project risks.   Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it  builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates  and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty.  Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates  and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project.   Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary,  Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes  be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds  the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk  into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and  schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of con dence  for meeting project objectives.  5 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 1 CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION  There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of  risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not  mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different  ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the  more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be.   A risk management approach is applicable throughout a projects life cycle. The earlier in the project life  cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk  management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available  about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and  cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project  exibility and  knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop.   It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in  place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced.  During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new  risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing  risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for  the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future.   Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, riskrelated lessons are reviewed in order to  contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management  practice. ",Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. it should be applied to all projects and therefore be included in project plans and operational documents. risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses.
" Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of  the other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be  conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other  processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is  appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the  multicultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture  projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe.   Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may  require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets,  make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of  accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and  external requirements.  6 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 1 CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION  Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project  Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing  with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk  Management bene ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement  among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identi cation, analysis, and response,  in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other  unreasonable in uences.   Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of  tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the  characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large  project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and  attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, shortterm, internal project that can be conducted  in the background with a  exible deadline.   Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under  management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions  made in that process remain appropriate. ","Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, internal project."
" Figure 12. Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management  7 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 1 CHAPTER 1  INTRODUCTION  Speci c criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing  with those processes. The general criteria for success include:     Recognize the Value of Risk Management     Project Risk Management should be recognized  as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational  management, project stakeholders , project management, and team  members.     Individual CommitmentResponsibility     Project participants and stakeholders should all accept  responsibility for undertaking riskrelated activities as required. Risk management is everybodys  responsibility.     Open and Honest Communication     Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management  process.  Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness  of Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decisionmaking.     Organizational Commitment     Organizational commitment can only be established if risk  management is aligned with the organizations goals and values. Project Risk Management may  require a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because  handling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the  project manager.     Risk Effort Scaled to Project     Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value  of the project to the organization and with its level of project risk, its scale, and other organizational  constraints. In particular, the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential  value to the project and the organization.     Integration with Project Management    Project Risk Management does not exist in a vacuum,  isolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires  the correct execution of the other project management processes.   These critical success factors for Project Risk Management are illustrated in Figure 12. ",Speci c criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing with those processes. Recognize the Value of Risk Management Project Risk Management should be recognized as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational management.
 The principles of Project Risk Management described in this practice standard should be appropriately  applied based on the speci cs of a project and the organizational environment. Project Risk Management  provides bene ts when it is implemented according to good practice principles and with organizational  commitment to taking the decisions and performing actions in an open and unbiased manner.  9 2009 Project Management Institute.

 This chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply Project Risk Management to projects  following the approach described in Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK    Guide   Fourth Edition. These principles and  concepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although  the terminology may differ in some details.   The execution of the Project Risk Management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice  standard and so is not discussed here. ,this chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply Project Risk Management to projects following the approach described in Chapter 11 of the PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition. these principles and concepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although the terminology may differ in some details.
" The word risk is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use  in the  PMBOK    Guide   Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process  descriptions. The de nition of project risk given in the  PMBOK    Guide  Fourth Edition is as follows:    Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative  effect on a projects objectives.   This de nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a projects objectives. When  assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty  dimension may be described using the term probability and the effect may be called impact .   The de nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and  more general conditions which are less speci c but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The de nition of project  risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a projects objectives, as  well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and  opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uni ed Project Risk Management  process. This allows for the gain of synergies and ef ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses  and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.  10 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 2 CHAPTER 2  PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS  Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they  did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from riskrelated features, such as cause and effect. Causes are  events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise  to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project  objectives if the associated risk occurs. The causeriskeffect chain can be used in a structured risk statement  or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described .   When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or  problems; opportunities which occur may be called bene ts. Both issuesproblems and bene ts entail project  management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process. ","project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a projects objectives. the de nition of project risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described. the de nition of project risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a projects objectives."
" It is useful to consider project risk at two levels: individual risks and overall project risk.   Individual risks are speci c events or conditions that might affect project objectives. An individual risk  may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding  individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project  success. Daytoday Project Risk Management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the  prospects of a successful project outcome.   Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is  more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual  elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project  outcome. It is an important component of strategic decisionmaking, program and portfolio management,  and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher  levels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency  reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether  the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances. ","individual risks are speci c events or conditions that might affect project objectives. an individual risk may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole."
" The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall  project risk matters. A wide range of factors in uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project  within the range of stakeholders overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the  performance of the project, and the stakeholders sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts,  industrial relations, and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased  certainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk  is regarded is usually also strongly in uenced by an organizations culture. Different organizations are more  or less open, and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied.  11 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 2 CHAPTER 2  PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS  Understanding stakeholders attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning  that precedes risk identi cation and analysis, in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder  satisfaction with the projects results. These attitudes should be identi ed and managed proactively and  deliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another  for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single  stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project.   It is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where  the team is international, crossindustry, or multiorganizational. ","the risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall project risk matters. these include the scale of the project within the range of stakeholders overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the performance of the project. a single stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project."
" It is the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. The amount  of information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will  not, new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identi ed may change. As a  result, the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively  elaborated throughout the lifetime of the project.   To ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective, the identi cation and analysis of risks should  be revisited periodically, the progress on risk response actions should be monitored, and the action plans  adjusted accordingly. If external circumstances change signi cantly, it may also be necessary to revisit the risk  management planning process.   The development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process, not  the end. The frequency and depth of reviews and updates will depend on the nature of the project, the volatility  of the environment in which the project is being implemented, and the timing of other project management  reviews and updates. ","the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. the amount of information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. some risks will occur while others will not, new risks will arise or be discovered."
 Project Risk Management cannot take place in isolation. Success relies heavily on communication  throughout the process.   Risk identi cation and analysis depend on comprehensive input from stakeholders in a project to ensure  that nothing signi cant is overlooked and that risks are realistically assessed. The credibility of the process  and the commitment of those who should act to manage risks can be assured only if the way the process  operates and the conclusions it produces are understood and seen as credible by all concerned. This demands  effective and honest communication from the Project Risk Management process to the rest of the project team  and other project stakeholders. Communication of the results of the Project Risk Management process should  be targeted to meet the speci c needs of each stakeholder and should be re ected within the overall project  communications strategy with each stakeholders responsibility and role in risk management identi ed and  agreedupon.  12 2009 Project Management Institute.

" It may be considered simplistic to say risk management is everyones responsibility as previously stated.  However it is important that management of project risk is not left to a few risk specialists. Project Risk  Management should be included as an integral part of all other project processes. Since project risks can  affect project objectives, anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in Project Risk  Management. The speci c roles depend on the project team members and other stakeholders place within  the project and their relation to project objectives. Roles and responsibilities for Project Risk Management  should be clearly de ned and communicated, and individuals should be held responsible and accountable  for results. This includes allocating responsibility for speci c activities within the risk process, as well as for  resulting actions required to implement agreedupon responses. Responsibility should also be allocated for  ensuring that riskrelated lessons are captured for future use. ",project risk management should be included as an integral part of all other project processes. anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in Project Risk Management.
" The project manager has particular responsibilities in relation to the Project Risk Management process.  The project manager has overall responsibility for delivering a successful project which fully meets the de ned  objectives. The project manager is accountable for the daytoday management of the project, including  effective risk management. The role of the project manager may include:   Encouraging senior management support for Project Risk Management activities.     Determining the acceptable levels of risk for the project in consultation with stakeholders.     Developing and approving the risk management plan.     Promoting the Project Risk Management process for the project.     Facilitating open and honest communication about risk within the project team and with    management and other stakeholders.   Participating in all aspects of the Project Risk Management process.     Approving risk responses and associated actions prior to implementation.     Applying project contingency funds to deal with identi ed risks that occur during the project.     Overseeing risk management by subcontractors and suppliers.      Regularly reporting risk status to key stakeholders, with recommendations for appropriate strategic    decisions and actions to maintain acceptable risk exposure.    Escalating identi ed risks to senior management where appropriate: such risks include any which are    outside the authority or control of the project manager, any which require input or action from outside  the project, and any for which the release of management reserve funds might be appropriate.   Monitoring the ef ciency and effectiveness of the Project Risk Management process.     Auditing risk responses for their effectiveness and documenting lessons learned.    13 2009 Project Management Institute.

" All projects are uncertain. Uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings  based on assumptions and constraints, delivering project results to multiple stakeholders with different  requirements. Project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment, through  the use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating, planning, cost control, task allocation,  earned value analysis, monitoring and review meetings, etc. Each of these elements of project management  has a role in de ning or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects.   Project Risk Management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood, assessed, and  managed within projects. As such it forms an integral part of project management, and effective Project Risk  Management is a critical success factor for project success.   For project management to be fully effective, however, it is important that Project Risk Management is not  viewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task. Since many elements of project  management address inherent uncertainty, the interface between structured Project Risk Management and the  other processes of project management needs to be clear. The outputs of Project Risk Management should be  taken into account within many of the project management processes. They can, for example, impact:   Estimating resource requirements, cost, or duration;     Assessing the impact of proposed scope changes;     Planning or replanning the forward strategy of the project;     Allocating resources to tasks; and     Reporting progress to stakeholders.     None of these actions can be performed properly without a clear view of the risk involved, as determined  during the Project Risk Management process. In other words, project management process effectiveness is  increased by using the information and results from Project Risk Management.   In addition, effective Project Risk Management requires input from other project management processes.  Outputs such as the work breakdown structure , estimates, the project schedule, assumptions list, etc.  are all important prerequisites for effective Project Risk Management.  14 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 3 CHAPTER 3  INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES","projects are unique and temporary undertakings based on assumptions and constraints, delivering project results to multiple stakeholders with different requirements. project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment through the use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating, planning, cost control, task allocation, earned value analysis, monitoring and review meetings."
" The de ned steps of Project Risk Management describe a structured approach for understanding and  managing risk on a project. This chapter outlines the steps required for effective Project Risk Management.  Each step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters.   As previously de ned, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or  negative effect on a projects objectives. From this de nition, it is clear that risks only exist in relation to  objectives. It is therefore essential at the start of the Project Risk Management process to clearly de ne the  objectives. It is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk, so each step in the  Project Risk Management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk. Scalable elements  of the process include:   Available resources,     Methodology and processes used,     Tools and techniques used,     Supporting infrastructure,     Review and update frequency, and     Reporting requirements.     As a precondition for a successful Project Risk Management implementation, it is important to have a clear  understanding of the risk thresholds that de ne the key stakeholders views on acceptable levels of risk, as  well as a framework against which identi ed risks can be assessed.   As a result, the Project Risk Management process always starts with an initiation step. This is required in  order to ensure a common understanding and agreement of the team and other stakeholders on the approach  and parameters that will be applied in managing risk in this project, as well as the scope and objectives of the  Project Risk Management process itself. Project Risk Management activities, resources, and attention should  be appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application.  The main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows:   De ne those objectives against which risks will be identi ed,     De ne how the elements of the Project Risk Management process will be scaled for this    project, and   De ne risk thresholds, tolerances, and the assessment framework.     The outputs from this initial step should be documented, communicated, and then reviewed by the  stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the scope and objectives for the Project Risk Management  process. The document should be formally approved at a senior level.  15 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 3 CHAPTER 3  INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  Once the Project Risk Management scope and objectives are agreed upon, it is possible to start identifying  risks, being careful to distinguish genuine risks from nonrisks .  A variety of risk identi cation techniques is available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One or  more techniques should be selected as appropriate for meeting the needs of the speci c project. The aim is  to expose and document all knowable risks, recognizing that some risks will be inherently unknowable and  others will emerge later in the project. The emergent nature of risk requires the Project Risk Management  process to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process in order to  nd risks which were not evident earlier  in the project. Input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders when identifying risks, since  each will have a different perspective on the risks facing the project. Historical records and project documents  should also be reviewed to identify risks for this project.   All identi ed risks are recorded. Ideally, a risk owner is designated for each identi ed risk. It is the  responsibility of the risk owner to manage the corresponding risk through all of the subsequent Project Risk  Management processes.   Following risk identi cation, it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each risk, in order to prioritize  individual risks for further attention, evaluate the level of overall project risk, and determine appropriate  responses. Risk evaluation can be performed using qualitative techniques to address individual risks, using  quantitative techniques to consider the overall effect of risk on the project outcome, or using both in combination.  These two approaches require different types of data, but where both qualitative and quantitative techniques  are used, an integrated approach should be adopted.   Qualitative techniques are used to gain a better understanding of individual risks, considering a range  of characteristics such as probability of occurrence, degree of impact on project objectives, manageability,  timing of possible impacts, relationships with other risks, common causes or effects, etc. Understanding and  prioritizing risks is an essential prerequisite to managing them, so qualitative techniques are used on most  projects. The outputs from qualitative assessments should be documented and communicated to key project  stakeholders and form a basis for determining appropriate responses.   Quantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identi ed risks on the project outcome.  These techniques take into account probabilistic or projectwide effects, such as correlation between risks,  interdependency, and feedback loops, thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The  result is an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The results of quantitative analysis  should be used to focus the development of appropriate responses, particularly the calculation of required  contingency reserve levels, and must be documented and communicated to inform subsequent actions.  Quantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk.  16 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 3 CHAPTER 3  INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  Once individual risks have been prioritized and the degree of overall project risk exposure is understood,  appropriate risk responses should be developed using an iterative process which continues until an optimal  set of responses has been developed. A range of possible response strategies exists for both threats and  opportunities. The risk owner should select a suitable strategy for each individual risk, based on its characteristics  and assessed priority, ensuring that the strategy is achievable, affordable, cost effective, and appropriate. The  use of a single strategy that addresses several related risks should be considered whenever possible. The risk  owner is responsible for de ning actions to implement the chosen strategy. These actions may be delegated to  action owners as appropriate. The risk owner should monitor actions to determine their effectiveness, and also  to identify any secondary risks which may arise because of the implementation of risk responses. In addition  to individual risk responses, actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk. All response strategies  and actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the  project plan.   It is essential that agreedupon actions are implemented; otherwise the risk exposure of the project remains  unchanged. It is also vital that the Project Risk Management process be repeated at regular intervals throughout  the life of the project. This will enable the project team to reevaluate the status of previously identi ed risks,  to identify emergent and secondary risks, and to determine the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management  process.   The steps outlined previously form the Project Risk Management process. These are detailed in subsequent  chapters, as follows:     Plan Risk Management    De nes the scope and objectives of the Project Risk  Management process, and ensures that the risk process is fully integrated into wider project  management.     Identify Risks    Identi es as many knowable risks as practicable.     Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis    Evaluates key characteristics of individual risks  enabling them to be prioritized for further action.

" The objectives of the Plan Risk Management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy  for the project, to decide how the risk management processes will be executed, and to integrate Project Risk  Management with all other project management activities.   Effective risk management requires creation of a risk management plan. This plan describes how the  risk management processes should be carried out and how they  t in with the other project management  processes. On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management, general project  management, and the management processes in the rest of the organization. To provide the greatest bene t,  initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the  corresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan. The risk  management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders  become clearer or change.   Although the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management  plan, a budget in terms of resources, cost, and time for the speci c risk management activities should be  established in order to better track, control, and, as necessary, defend the corresponding expenditures  throughout the project. The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project  budget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated,  allocated, and managed. The risk management plan will de ne the monitoring methods to ensure that the  corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately, as well as the conditions under which the approved  budget for risk management can be modi ed.   In the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration, risk management  activities need to be repeated throughout the project. The risk management plan should de ne both the  normal frequency for repeating the processes as well as speci c or exceptional conditions under which the  corresponding actions should be initiated. The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated  into the project management plan.   There are two categories of success criteria for risk management: those for success of the project in  general, and those for success of Project Risk Management.  20 4 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management CHAPTER 4  PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT    ProjectRelated Criteria.  To assess the success of Project Risk Management, the stakeholders  must agree on an acceptable level of results for the projectrelated criteria . In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders, the risk management  plan should present these objectives with reference to the project de nition documents. To provide  guidance in risk management, particularly in prioritizing risk responses, stakeholders should also  prioritize each project objective.     ProcessRelated Criteria.  The measures for success in Project Risk Management depend on a  number of factors, such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project. For example, the Project  Risk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than  for a project with a more predictable environment. A research Project Risk Management process  may be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be  allowable for a successful process in a more predictable project.   The level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant  stakeholders. The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be in uenced by a number  of factors, all of which need to be identi ed. These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty, and the  relative importance to them of achieving or missing speci c project objectives. The output of this analysis  should then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the  Project Risk Management processes in the speci c project.   Guidelines and rules for escalating riskrelated information to management and other stakeholders should  re ect the risk attitudes and expectations of the corresponding stakeholders. The project manager should  maintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves, in order to become aware of  any changes in the stakeholders attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts  into account.   It is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks,  and that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be de ned in a  manner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders. If qualitative analysis  uses such terms as high impact or medium probability, these should be de ned objectively in the risk  management plan. Similarly, the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in  quantitative analysis or for decisionmaking in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control.   Risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a  template of the risk register that will be used for recording riskrelated information. The risk management plan  should also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management  processes should be applied; this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the speci ed risk  management objectives.   In order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively, the project  team and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate, their criteria  for determining success, their level of authority, and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond  this level. The risk management plan speci es the projects risk management roles and responsibilities and  de nes the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel.  21 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 4 CHAPTER 4  PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT  Riskrelated communication occurs at two levels:  within the project team, and  between the project  team and the other project stakeholders. The principles for each of these categories of communication are  de ned in the risk management plan. For the team, the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various  risk management meetings and reports required to carry out the corresponding Project Risk Management  processes as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports. For the other stakeholders, the  plan sets their expectations as to the structure, content, and frequency of routine documents to be received  as well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events. Details of the  information required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly de ned. ","the plan risk management process is to develop the overall risk management strategy for the project. it describes how the risk management processes should be carried out and how they t in with the other project management processes. to provide the greatest bene t, initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project. the risk management plan should de ne the monitoring methods to ensure that the corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately."
" The principal criteria for a valid risk management plan are acceptance by the stakeholders, alignment  with the internal and external constraints on the project, balance between cost or effort and bene t, and  completeness with respect to the needs of the Project Risk Management process. Critical success factors for  the Plan Risk Management process are detailed below. ","the principal criteria for a valid risk management plan are acceptance by the stakeholders, alignment with the internal and external constraints on the project, balance between cost or effort and bene t. critical success factors for the Plan Risk Management process are detailed below."
" The time and effort required to carry out the Plan Risk Management process will not be supported unless  the stakeholders, and especially management in the organization responsible for the project, recognize and  accept the bene ts of managing risk, and the added value of addressing this as a skill in its own right rather  than as a passive or reactive component of general project management.   A clear de nition of the project objectives and a highlevel view of the project environment and solution  approach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management. The project manager should therefore  ensure that valid de nition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity.   An organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and  may expend an inappropriate amount of time and effort on this. Alternatively it may use a proprietary or  preexisting approach which requires tailoring. The availability of some or all of the following organizational  process assets contributes to the chances of success of the Plan Risk Management activities: standard  templates, prede ned risk categories, and an established project management methodology incorporating  risk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making, when it is  required, and a de nition of concepts and terms, roles, responsibilities, and authority levels. Access to relevant  lessons learned at this stage will allow this experience to be taken into account from the start of the project.   The risk management plan will not deliver its value unless Project Risk Management is carried out as  an integral part of the project. The corresponding activities should be built into the project work breakdown  structure and included in the corresponding schedule, budget, and workassignment documents.  22 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 4 CHAPTER 4  PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT",a clear de nition of the project objectives and a highlevel view of the project environment and solution approach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management. an organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and may expend an inappropriate amount of time and effort on this.
" The project manager needs to involve the project stakeholders in the Plan Risk Management activities to  build on their skills and experience as well as to ensure their understanding of, and commitment to, the full  Project Risk Management process.   The provision for risk management resources speci ed within the risk management plan should be  approved by management at a level adequate for carrying out the required Project Risk Management processes  in accordance with agreedupon objectives. Management should be involved in the analysis of the level of  resourcing required for managing project risk and accept the risks that may arise from speci c limitations  placed on the provision of resources. Disagreements between stakeholders in the areas of risk tolerance and  evaluation measures should be addressed and resolved. ",the project manager needs to involve the project stakeholders to build on their skills and experience. the provision for risk management resources speci ed within the risk management plan should be approved by management at a level adequate for carrying out the required Project Risk Management processes.
" The feasibility of risk management planning is dependent upon the features of the organization in which  it is carried out. The rules and guidelines de ned in the risk management plan should be compatible with the  culture of the organization, its capabilities from the point of view of people and facilities, and its values, goals,  and objectives.   Project management in general, and risk management in particular, contribute to the organizations effective  governance. The risk management plan should identify and take into account the relevant organizational  procedures and any other enterprise environmental factors that apply such as strategic risk management or  corporate governance processes.

" Planning sessions are recommended in order to build a common understanding of the projects risk approach  between project stakeholders and to gain agreement on the techniques to be used for managing risk.   Elaboration of the risk management plan often serves to develop an effective means for the team to work  together since a similar consultative team approach will be used in subsequent stages of the risk management  process. The participants should include: the project manager, selected project team members and other  stakeholders, members of the broader organization having responsibility for risk, and other subject matter  experts or facilitators, as needed.   At this point, the initial risk responsibilities, methodology, templates, terms, de nitions, time schedules, and  cost budgets for the other Project Risk Management processes should be assigned and accepted. The speci cation  for the tools that will be used in subsequent processes should include all parameters and other inputs required  to ensure their applicability to the speci c project. These should be documented in the risk management plan,  which, when formally approved, is the principal deliverable of the Plan Risk Management process.  23 2009 Project Management Institute.

" In order to bene t from experience and existing best practice, risk management planning should take into  account relevant existing templates for work products, such as risk status reports, risk breakdown structures  or the risk register. A decision should be made as to which templates are relevant to the project, and these  should then be adapted and included in the risk management plan. ","risk management planning should take into account relevant existing templates for work products. risk status reports, risk breakdown structures or risk register should be included in risk management plan."
" The results of risk management planning are documented in the risk management plan. The plan serves  to provide all project stakeholders with a common view of how the riskrelated activities of the project will be  handled, what has been agreed upon, and a description of the stakeholders involvement and responsibilities  in these activities. An overview of the key areas of focus is given in Figure 41.     Figure 41. Key Areas of Focus for the Plan Risk Management Process   Depending upon the size and complexity of the project, some or all of the following elements will be present  in a risk management plan.   Introduction;     Project description;     Risk management methodology;     Risk management organization;     Roles, responsibilities, and authority;     Stakeholder risk tolerance;     Criteria for success;     Risk management tools and guidelines for use;     Thresholds and corresponding de nitions;     Templates;     Communications plan;     Strategy; and     Risk breakdown structure.    25 2009 Project Management Institute.

" A risk cannot be managed unless it is  rst identi ed. Consequently, after risk management planning has  been completed, the  rst process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the  knowable risks to project objectives.   It is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time, the level of project  risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project   and of externally imposed change.   The purpose of risk identi cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that  some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify  Risks process to  nd new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process.   When a risk is  rst identi ed, potential responses may also be identi ed at the same time. These should be  recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate.  Where such responses are not implemented immediately, these should be considered during the Plan Risk  Responses process.

" Risk identi cation should be performed as early as possible in the project lifecycle, recognizing the paradox  that uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the  risk identi cation. Early risk identi cation enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks  inherent in the project, and may result in changes to the project strategy. It also maximizes the time available  for development and implementation of risk responses, which enhances ef ciency since responses taken early  are often normally less costly than later ones.  26 2009 Project Management Institute.

" Since not all risks can be identi ed at any given point in the project, it is essential that risk identi cation is  repeated throughout the project life cycle. This should be done periodically, at a frequency determined during  the Plan Risk Management process. Risk identi cation might also be repeated at key milestones in the project,  or whenever there is signi cant change to the project or its operating environment. ",risk identi cation should be repeated throughout the project life cycle. risk identi cation may also be repeated at key milestones in the project.

" Each identi ed project risk should relate to at least one project objective ,  noting that the  PMBOK    Guide  de nes risk as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive  or a negative effect on a projects objectives. Consideration of each project objective during the Identify Risks  process will assist in identifying risks, noting that some risks may affect more than one objective. ",each identi ed project risk should relate to at least one project objective. consideration of each project objective during the Identify Risks process will assist in identifying risks.
" Identi ed risks should be clearly and unambiguously described, so that they can be understood by those  responsible for risk assessment and risk response planning. Single words or phrases such as resources  or logistics are inadequate and do not properly communicate the nature of the risk. More detailed risk  descriptions are required which explicitly state the uncertainty and its causes and effects.  27 2009 Project Management Institute.

" Risks can be identi ed at a number of levels of detail. A generalized or highlevel description of risk can  make it dif cult to develop responses and assign ownership, while describing risks in a lot of detail can create  a great deal of work. Each risk should be described at a level of detail at which it can be assigned to a single  risk owner with clear responsibility and accountability for its management. Trigger conditions should also be  identi ed where this is possible and appropriate. ",risk can be identi ed at a number of levels of detail. a generalized or highlevel description of risk can make it dif cult to develop responses and assign ownership. each risk should be described at a level of detail.
" All human activities are susceptible to bias, especially when dealing with uncertainty. Both motivational  biases, where someone is trying to bias the result in one direction or another, or cognitive biases, where  biases occur as people are using their best judgment and applying heuristics, may occur. This should be  explicitly recognized and addressed during the Identify Risks process. Sources of bias should be exposed  wherever possible, and their effect on the risk process should be managed proactively. The aim is to minimize  subjectivity, and allow open and honest identi cation of as many risks as possible to the project.

" A range of tools and techniques is available for risk identi cation. These fall into the following three  categories, as illustrated in Figure 51:   Figure 51.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 5 CHAPTER 5  IDENTIFY RISKS","a range of tools and techniques is available for risk identi cation. these fall into the following three categories, as illustrated in Figure 51."
" Historical reviews are based on what occurred in the past, either on this project, or other similar projects  in the same organization, or comparable projects in other organizations. Historical review approaches rely on  careful selection of comparable situations which are genuinely similar to the current project, and  ltering of  data to ensure that only relevant previous risks are considered. In each case, the risks identi ed in the selected  historical situation should be considered, asking whether they or similar risks might arise in this project. ",historical review approaches rely on careful selection of comparable situations. the risks identi ed in the selected historical situation should be considered.

",current assessments rely on detailed consideration of the current project. current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points. current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points.
" A wide range of creativity techniques can be used for risk identi cation, which encourages project  stakeholders to use their imagination to  nd risks which might affect the project. The outcomes or effectiveness  of these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively. These techniques can be used  either singly or in groups, and employ varying degrees of structure. These techniques depend on the ability of  participants to think creatively, and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator.   Each category of risk identi cation technique has strengths and weaknesses, and no single technique  can be expected to reveal all knowable risks. Consequently, the Identify Risks process for a particular project  should use a combination of techniques, perhaps selecting one from each category. For example, a project may  choose to use a risk identi cation checklist , together with assumptions analysis  and brainstorming .   Use of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project, a prompt  list, or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk as practicable have  been addressed, while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can they replace original thinking.  29 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 5 CHAPTER 5  IDENTIFY RISKS  Whichever risk identi cation techniques are used, it is important that identi ed risks are unambiguously  described in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or  diluted by nonrisks. Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity. Risk metalanguage offers a useful  way of distinguishing a risk from its cause and effect, describing each risk using threepart statements in  the form: As a result of cause, risk may occur, which would lead to effect. The relationship between cause,  risk, and effect is shown in Figure 52.     Figure 52. Cause, Risk, and Effect ",risk identi cation techniques can be used either singly or in groups. these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively. each category of risk identi cation technique has strengths and weaknesses. no one can be expected to reveal all knowable risks.
" The results from the Identify Risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information  currently available for each identi ed risk. The main output from the Identify Risks process is the risk register.  This includes a properly structured risk description and the nominated risk owner for each risk, and may also  include information on the causes and effects of the risk, trigger conditions, and preliminary responses.  31 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 6  CHAPTER 6   PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS ",the main output from the Identify Risks process is the risk register. this includes a properly structured risk description and the nominated risk owner for each risk.
"Analysis Process   The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually  identi ed project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreedupon characteristics.   Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur  and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives. As such it does not directly address the overall  risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with  each other. This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques .   One step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes. If several risks arise  from a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus  on addressing this root cause.   Identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identi cation of the areas of greatest risk exposure  , facilitating risk response  focus in these areas.   The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify  Risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most in uence   on achieving the projects objectives. Risks that are assessed as high priority to either  threaten or to enhance the achievement of project objectives will be an important focus in the Plan Risk  Responses process. They may be further analyzed, such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is  discussed in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. ",quantitative risk analysis is applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify Risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most in uence on achieving the projects objectives.
"Analysis Process   Several factors that lead to successful qualitative risk analysis are described in Sections 6.2.1 through  6.2.4, and summarized in Figure 61. Agreement of the project stakeholders is a fundamental criterion and  a common theme. The agreedupon approach is the foundation of process credibility. Then, agreedupon  de nitions enable highquality information to be collected. Finally, with these conditions in place, the process  can be executed reliably, which contributes to the credibility of its outputs.  32 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 6 CHAPTER 6  PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS    Figure 6 1. Building Risk Analysis Credibility ","the agreedupon approach is the foundation of process credibility. the process can be executed reliably, which contributes to the credibility of its outputs."
" The process is based on an agreedupon approach to this assessment that is applied across all of the  identi ed risks in any project. By the nature of project risk, all risks may be assessed according to probability  of occurrence and impact on individual objectives should the risk occur. Other factors may be considered in  determining the importance of a risk as follows:      Urgency .  Risks requiring near term responses may be considered more urgent to  address. Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the  clarity of symptoms and warning signs  that may trigger the response.   Manageability.     Some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to  address them. The project team may examine these and decide to:   Go forward, perhaps establishing a contingency reserve.      Stop or rescope the project because these risks pose an unmanageable threat or an      opportunity that should not be missed with high probability and consequences.   Inform the customer of the risks and ask for a decision from their point of view.        Impact external to the project.      A risk may increase in importance if it affects the enterprise beyond  the project. ",identi ed risks may be assessed according to probability of occurrence and impact on individual objectives. risks requiring near term responses may be considered more urgent to address.
" The risk assessment should be based on agreedupon de nitions of important terms, and those de nitions  should be used consistently when assessing each risk. The use of de nitions, for example, of levels of probability  and of impact on objectives, assists the providers of the information in giving realistic assessments for each  risk, and facilitates the communication of the results to management and other stakeholders.  33 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 6 CHAPTER 6  PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS",risk assessment should be based on agreedupon de nitions of important terms. the use of de nitions helps the providers of the information in giving realistic assessments for each risk.
" Collection of highquality information about risks is required. Often this information is not available in any  historic database and should be gathered by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment. Data  gathered from individuals may be subject to reporting or intentional bias. When this occurs, the bias should be  identi ed and remedied where possible, or a different, unbiased source of information should be found and used. ","data gathered from individuals may be subject to reporting or intentional bias. bias should be identi ed and remedied where possible, or a different, unbiased source should be found and used."
" The success of qualitative risk analysis is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project. It  is impossible to know in advance all the risks that may occur in a project, therefore the Identify Risks and Perform  Qualitative Analysis processes should be repeated periodically for individual risks. The frequency of this effort will  be planned in the Plan Risk Management process, but may also depend on events within the project itself.

 Qualitative risk analysis tools provide ways to distinguish those risks that are important for response or  further analysis from those that are less important. The criteria that make a risk of interest to management are  agreed upon in advance and implemented in the tools used. Output from qualitative risk analysis tools includes  a listing of risks in priority order or in priority groups .   The tools for qualitative risk analysis allow the organization or project stakeholders to specify those levels  or combinations of risk characteristics that make a particular risk of interest to management.

 Some tools permit distinguishing a risks priority in terms of the affected objective.

This is useful since it is  common for risks to have uneven impacts on various project objectives. ,some tools permit distinguishing a risks priority in terms of the affected objective. this capability provides a list of risks that are important for any speci c objective of interest to management.
" There are reasons for constructing a measure of a speci c risks importance to the entire project as  contrasted with its importance to speci c objectives. A common reason is for ease of communication with  management and other stakeholders. When a single risk prioritization index is needed, the organization should  be explicit about how that index is created. Usually the index re ects the organizations preference among  objectives. The technique for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented in the Plan Risk  Management process.  35 2009 Project Management Institute.

" Categorizing risks appropriately may lead to improved analysis of the probability and magnitude of  project risk and to effective responses. Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better  understanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate  and independent events. Identifying common root causes of a group of risks, for instance, may reveal both the  magnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several  risks simultaneously. Alternatively, some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain, and understanding  the chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project. Identifying risks  that can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of  problems of risk mitigation using scarce resources.   Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure   can show clusters of priority risks arising from speci c sources. A combination  of the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure  can show which areas of the project  exhibit the most risk. Assessing the highpriority risks impact on one objective, such as the schedule, may  indicate which activities to address to reduce that objectives uncertainty. All of these approaches can contribute  to the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis.

" The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks  into categories of priority. Priorities are usually based on the risks probability of occurring  and its potential impact on speci c project objectives or on the whole project. Each identi ed risk is assigned  a priority, perhaps by objective or for the entire project. This information is usually stored in the risk register  which is easy to use and update with new information. The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the  project participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan. Risks that  are judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally  monitored frequently. Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less  often for changes in their status.  37 2009 Project Management Institute.

"Analysis Process   The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect of risk on  the objectives of the project, based on current plans and information, when considering risks simultaneously.  Results from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project  objectives and to estimate contingency reserves, usually for time and cost that are appropriate to both the risks  and the risk tolerance of project stakeholders.   It is generally accepted that analyzing uncertainty in the project using quantitative techniques such as  Monte Carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule  than a nonprobabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or lineitem cost estimates are  deterministic. However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate  for all projects. For example, qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of  effective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process,  the bene ts of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the  additional insights and value justify the additional effort.   Partial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time  and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously.  Calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.   Speci c project risks are usually best understood and quanti ed at a detailed level such as the lineitem  cost or schedule activity level. By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the projects budget or  the schedule are speci ed at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such  as one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quanti ed risks on project objectives.  The implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires:    Complete and accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project    elements. Examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate.    Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or lineitem costs at a    level of detail that lends itself to speci c assessment of individual risks.   Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements.      Applying a quantitative method  that incorporates    multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective.  38 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 7 CHAPTER 7  PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS  Results of the quantitative analysis will be compared to the project plan  to give  management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as:   What is the probability of meeting the projects objectives?      How much contingency reserve  is needed to    provide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance?    What are those parts of the project, such as lineitem costs or schedule activities, which contribute    the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously?   Which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk?     Estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quanti ed  risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders, from those for which the objectives are  within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered. The former may be targeted for vigorous risk  responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders.   A highlevel comparison of quantitative and qualitative risk analysis processes is presented in Figure 71.     Figure 71. Comparison of Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches ",results from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project objectives. quantitative risk analysis may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule than a nonprobabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or lineitem cost estimates are deterministic.

" An appropriate model of the project should be used as the basis for quantitative risk analysis.

" The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is based upon a methodology that correctly derives the  overall project risk from the individual risks. In risk analysis of cost and schedule, for example, an appropriate  method is Monte Carlo simulation. A decision tree is an appropriate method for making decisions when future  events are not certain, using the probability and impact of all risks, and combining their effect to derive an  overall project measure such as value or cost. In each of these methods, the risks are speci ed at the level  of the detailed tasks or lineitem costs and incorporated into the model of the project to calculate effects on  objectives such as schedule or cost for the entire project, by combining those risks.  40 2009 Project Management Institute.

" Attention should be given to the possibility that the individual risks in the project model are related to  each other. For example, several risks may have a common root cause and therefore are likely to occur  together. This possibility is sometimes addressed by correlating the risks that are related, ensuring that  they generally occur together during the analysis. Another common way to represent the risks which occur  together is by using the risk register listing of the risk or root cause and attaching it to several project  elements such as schedule activities or cost elements. When a particular risk occurs, the affected elements  will all experience the effect of that risk together. ",several risks may have a common root cause and therefore are likely to occur together. a common way to represent the risks which occur together is by using the risk register listing.

" Probability models use a quantitative method that addresses uncertainty. Speci cally, the methods should  be able to handle the way uncertainty is represented, predominantly as probability of an events occurring or as  probability distributions for a range of outcomes. A good example of this is the use of Monte Carlo simulation  tools that permit the combination of probability distributions of lineitem costs or schedule activity durations,  many of which are uncertain. ",probability models use a quantitative method that addresses uncertainty. the methods should be able to handle the way uncertainty is represented. a good example of this is the use of Monte Carlo simulation tools.
" Data gathering tools used in this process include assessment of historical data and workshops, interviews, or  questionnaires to gather quanti ed informationfor example, on the probability of a risk occurring, a probability  distribution of its potential impacts on cost or time, or relationships such as correlation between risks.  41 2009 Project Management Institute.

" Results from the quantitative tools are generally not available in standard deterministic project management  methods such as project scheduling or cost estimating. Examples of these are the probability distribution of  project completion dates or total costs and the expected value of a project decision. These results, when all  risks are considered simultaneously, include the following:   Probability of achieving a project objective such as  nishing on time or within budget.

 The success of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is enhanced if the process is used periodically  throughout the project.

" Overall project contingency reserve in time and cost should be re ected in the projects schedule and  budget.

"Analysis Process   The contingency reserves calculated in quantitative project cost and schedule risk analysis are incorporated,  respectively, into the cost estimate and the schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation  for the project. Contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that  are judged to be priorities for the project. If the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources  available, changes in the project scope and plan may result.   Also, the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response  depending on the probability of achieving the plans objectives or the amount of contingency reserve  required to provide the necessary level of con dence.

" The objective of the Plan Risk Responses process is to determine the set of actions which most enhance the  chances of project success while complying with applicable organizational and project constraints.   Once risks have been identi ed, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every  risk the project team considers to be suf ciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project  objectives or the opportunity it offers. The planning entails agreeing upon the actions to be taken and the  potential changes to budget, schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause.   Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason, the response  speci cation for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions.   The responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should  be clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process,  and each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a speci c risk action owner. The risk  owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses  if required, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreedupon risk responses are  carried out as planned, in a timely manner. The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be  assigned to a single person.   Responses, when implemented, can have potential effects on the project objectives and, as such, can  generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the  same way as those risks which were initially identi ed.   It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly, there is also a limit  to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain  after the responses have been implemented. These residual risks should be clearly identi ed, analyzed,  documented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.  44 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 8 CHAPTER 8  PLAN RISK RESPONSES  All the approved, unconditional actions arising from risk response planning should be integrated into the  project management plan in order to ensure that they are carried out as part of normal project implementation. The  corresponding organizational and project management rules should also be invoked, including the following:   Project change management and con guration control;     Project planning, budgeting, and scheduling;     Resource management; and     Project communication planning.   ","plan risk response actions should be identi ed, analyzed, documented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders. each risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process. each risk response should now be assigned to a speci c risk action owner."
 A range of factors are important for the success of the Plan Risk Responses process. These are described  in Sections 8.2.1 through 8.2.8 and shown in Figure 81.     Figure 81. Critical Success Factors for Risk Response Planning ,a range of factors are important for the success of the Plan Risk Responses process. these are described in sections 8.2.1 through 8.2.8 and shown in Figure 81.
" Communication with the various stakeholders should be maintained in an open and appropriate manner. The  resulting plans are disseminated and approval obtained in order to ensure full acceptance by all stakeholders.   In addition, if organizational causes of risks, such as culture, attitudes, or disagreements concerning  objectives are present, they should be addressed openly. This may require involving high levels of the  organizations management and other stakeholders.  45 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 8 CHAPTER 8  PLAN RISK RESPONSES",communication should be maintained in an open and appropriate manner. the resulting plans are disseminated and approval obtained in order to ensure full acceptance by all stakeholders.
" The risk response success will be dependent upon the full support and involvement of the project team and  other stakeholders. The key roles for Project Risk Management are those of risk owner and risk action owner.  A single risk owner should be assigned to every identi ed risk, and each agreedupon risk response should  have a single risk action owner. The people with the corresponding responsibilities should be aware of what is  expected of them, and the other project stakeholders should understand and accept the needs and authority  of these roles.   Management may take ownership of risks with political, organizational causes. In addition, senior  management should approve and track associated riskrelated contingency reserves. ","a single risk owner should be assigned to every identi ed risk. each agreedupon risk response should have a single risk action owner. management may take ownership of risks with political, organizational causes."

" Each response should be planned in detail in accordance with the methodology of the project and integrated  into the project management plan. This entails estimating the resources, costs, and duration; updating the  budget and schedule; obtaining approval from management; and obtaining commitment from the risk owners  and risk action owners. Managements role at this stage is vital for supporting the project manager in developing  risk responses and authorizing the corresponding resources. ","each response should be planned in detail in accordance with the methodology of the project. this entails estimating the resources, costs, and duration. managements role at this stage is vital for supporting the project manager in developing risk responses."
" Responses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause.  Categorization of risks, for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure, af nity diagram, or  other categorizing tools, may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk  Responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process  , and then to develop generic  responses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk, if it occurs, may affect  the probability or impact of other risks.   Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be  mutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money, thereby  increasing pressure on the budget. Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed  responses and make sure they are coherent.  46 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 8 CHAPTER 8  PLAN RISK RESPONSES  The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the  strategy developed for treating the original risk. If this is overlooked, the total level of threat in a project can  actually increase, or the potential for opportunities can be compromised. ","risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed responses. if this is overlooked, the total level of threat in a project can actually increase or the potential for opportunities can be compromised."
" In general, responses should be appropriate, timely, costeffective, feasible, achievable, agreedupon,  assigned, and accepted. Any proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria:   Consistency with organizational values, project objectives, and stakeholder expectations;     Technical feasibility;     Ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding    actions; and   Balance between overall impact of the response on the project objectives and the improvement in    the risk pro le of the project. ","any proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria: Consistency with organizational values, project objectives, and stakeholder expectations; Technical feasibility; Ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the appropriate actions."
" Risk response planning should combine responses that address the threats as well as those that provide  for opportunities into a single, integrated plan. If either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed, the  combined set of response strategies will be incomplete and may even be invalid. ","risk response planning should combine responses that address threats and opportunities into a single, integrated plan. if either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed, the combined set of response strategies will be incomplete and even invalid."
" Risk response planning should be carried out in an openminded manner rather than adopting the  rst  response that seems to be feasible. The responses should be planned at a general, strategic level and the  strategy validated and agreed upon, prior to developing the detailed tactical approach.   Once the responses have been planned at a strategic level, they should be expanded into actions at the tactical  level and integrated into the project management plan . This  activity may generate additional secondary risks, which will need to be addressed at this time. ","risk response planning should be carried out in an openminded manner. the responses should be planned at a general, strategic level. the strategy validated and agreed upon, prior to developing the detailed approach."
" The project manager should develop risk response strategies for individual risks, sets of risks, and project level risks. An overview of the steps in arriving at a complete set of responses is given in Figure 82.   The affected stakeholders should be involved in determining the strategies. Once the strategies have been  selected, they need to be agreed upon by the entity that approves those strategies. There are four strategies  which address individual risks for threats and opportunities as described in Sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.4 .  47 2009 Project Management Institute.

",acceptance entails taking no action unless the risk actually occurs. contingency or fallback plans may be developed ahead of time.
" In addition to responding to individual risks, the four risk response strategies can be applied to address  overall project risk as follows:   Cancel the project, as a last resort, if the overall level of risk remains unacceptable.     Set up a business structure in which the customer and the supplier share the risk.

",four risk response strategies can be applied to address overall project risk. cancel the project if overall level of risk remains unacceptable. set up a business structure in which the customer and supplier share the risk.
" There are four categories of tools and techniques, as follows:   Creativity tools to identify potential responses,     Decisionsupport tools for determining the optimal potential response.     Strategy implementation techniques designed to turn a strategy into action, and     Tools to transfer control to the Monitor and Control Risks process.    48 2009 Project Management Institute.

" The project manager needs to use resource assignment processes to ensure the availability of an owner for  each risk and for each response action, so that each associated risk is managed and each corresponding risk  response is carried out in a timely and effective manner.   To enable risk monitoring to identify the imminence or actual occurrence of the corresponding event, every  contingency response strategy should include a set of trigger conditions.

It is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these  conditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as de ned, in a timely  manner.   Once the Plan Risk Responses process is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions  should have been included and de ned in the current project management plan. The  rst action of risk  monitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary,  such as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions. This will then ensure  that the agreedupon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework.   The risk owners and risk action owners need to be briefed on any changes that may affect their  responsibilities. Effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager so  that the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of speci c risks,  apply their best efforts to track the associated trigger conditions and carry out the agreedupon responses in  a timely manner.   In addition to the response actions and trigger conditions, a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness  of the response is provided by the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk action owner should keep the risk  owner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been  effectively dealt with, or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented.  52 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 9 CHAPTER 9  MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS  As the project progresses, additional information becomes available and the project environment may  change as some risks occur, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and others become or cease to be relevant.  The planning should therefore be kept current and the project manager should ensure that periodic risk  reassessment, including risk identi cation, analysis, and response planning, is repeated at reasonable intervals,  or in response to project eventswithout generating excessive administrative overhead. Typical reasons for  risk reassessment are:   Occurrence of a major or unexpected risk,     Need to analyze a complex change request,     Phase end review,     Project replanning or major plan elaboration, and     Periodic review to ensure that the information remains current.     In the event of major organizational changes, risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to  reassessing the risks.   In addition to the regular status reviews, periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and  weaknesses in handling risks within the project. This should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or  keys to success in risk management, recognition of which could lead to improvements in risk management of  the current or future projects.   At the end of the project, an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out  with a focus on longterm process improvements. This analysis consolidates the  ndings of the periodic  audits to identify lessons that would be applicable in general to a large proportion of the organizations  projects in the future, such as appropriate levels of resources, adequate time for the analysis, use of tools,  level of detail, etc.   At project closure, the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure of  every risk in the risk register, for example:  did not occur;  occurred and contingency plan invoked; or   occurred and impact to the project scope .   The output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with speci c information  with respect to the projects experience of risks, and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization  should be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them. This can lead to an update to the  corresponding organizational process assets.   An overview of the steps involved in the Monitor and Control Risks process is given in Figure 91.    53 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 9 CHAPTER 9  MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS  Figure 91. Schematic Representation of the Monitor and Control Risks Process ","risk monitoring and controlling is to track identi ed risks, monitor residual risks, identify new risks, and evaluate their effectiveness throughout the project life cycle. it is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these conditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as de ned."

" From the start, the project management plan should include the actions required to monitor and control  project risk. This should be set up early in the project planning cycle, and then adjusted in view of the risk  response planning decisions adding, for example, the actions associated with monitoring speci c conditions  or metrics. Once risk response planning has been carried out, the project schedule should include all of the  agreedupon, responserelated actions so that they can be carried out as a normal part of project execution  and tracked accordingly.  54 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management 9 CHAPTER 9  MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS","the project management plan should include the actions required to monitor and control project risk. this should be set up early in the project planning cycle. the project schedule should include all agreedupon, response related actions."
" Risk response planning will have de ned a set of actions to be carried out as part of the project schedule  as well as actions whose execution is dependent on a prede ned trigger condition. Checking for speci cally  de ned risks that may trigger conditional responses is the responsibility of the risk action owner, in close  collaboration with the risk owner under the overall authority of the project manager. ",risk response planning will have de ned a set of actions to be carried out as part of the project schedule as well as actions whose execution is dependent on a prede ned trigger condition. the risk action owner will check for speci cally de ned risks that may trigger conditional responses.
" Risk management reports should be a regular item on every status meeting agenda to ensure that all team  members remain aware of the importance of risk management and to ensure that it is fully integrated into all  of the project management decisions.   The projects seniorlevel sponsor should require regular reports on the risks and the planned responses  to ensure that stakeholders are aware of the importance of keeping a focus on risk. Sponsor feedback also  motivates the project team by demonstrating seniorlevel interest in Project Risk Management.   Stakeholders perception of the effectiveness of risk management is conditioned in part by the way in  which risks are handled as they occur, and by the number or characteristics of such events. It is therefore  crucial, whenever a risk occurs, that information about the event, as well as the progress and effectiveness of  the responses, be communicated at regular intervals and in an honest manner adapted to the needs of each  stakeholder. This should be supported by a wellexecuted communications plan.

" Reserves may have been allocated separately to cover timerelated and costrelated risks. Techniques  are required that allow the project manager to assess at any point in the project whether these provide the  required level of con dence in the success of the project.   Tools for managing time buffers should be closely integrated into the projects scheduling techniques,  whereas those for managing cost should be compatible with the  nancial practices. Tools are required to  identify trends and forecast future outcomes to determine whether the reserves will remain suf cient. Tools  are also required for tracking progress and spending in a consolidated manner.  55 2009 Project Management Institute.

" Trigger conditions and the corresponding metrics are de ned during the Plan Risk Responses process.  Tools are required to evaluate and track these conditions against the project baseline or speci ed thresholds,  based on actual status. They can be chosen to provide information on risks related to the deliverables, such as  performance, as well as on projectrelated features, such as time and cost.

The goal is to ensure that the signi cant risk management information is recorded to provide concrete data  to the lessons learned process for inclusion in a lessons learned document, report, or other communication  vehicle. Typical information includes the following:   For each identi ed risk or type of risk, whether it occurred, and, if so, when and how often. All    relevant data should be recorded: impact, effectiveness of detection and of response, and any  unplanned, additional actions that were carried out.   Effectiveness of avoidance or exploitation actions.     Effectiveness of transfer and sharing actions.     Unexpected or undocumented risks which occurred and data about them.     Effectiveness of risk mitigation and enhancement actions.     Occurrence of accepted threats or opportunities.     Consolidated information should be provided on the level of effort expended. Costs and bene ts to the  project of risk management activities should also be provided.   This information will need to be archived and indexed in a manner that will facilitate retrieval for easy  review during the project, at closure, and for future projects, when the need arises.  57 2009 Project Management Institute.

" A PMI practice standard is characterized as follows:    Each practice standard provides guidelines on the mechanics  of some signi cant process   that is relevant to a project manager.    A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the lifecycle phases of many projects; however, an    individual practice standard may be applicable to the completion of one or more phases within a  project.    A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the Knowledge Areas within     A Guide to the Project  Management Body of Knowledge , although an individual practice  standard will provide suf cient detail and background for one or more of the inputs, tools and  techniques, andor outputs. Therefore, practice standards are not required to use the name of any  Knowledge Area.    Each practice standard should include information on what the signi cant process is and does,    why it is signi cant, how to perform it, when it should be performed, and, if necessary for further  clari cation, who should perform it.    Each practice standard should include information that is accepted and applicable for most projects    most of the time within the project management community. Processes that are generally restricted or  applicable to one industry, country, or companion profession  may be included  as an appendix for informational purposes, rather than as part of the practice standard. With strong  support and evidence, an application areaspeci c process may be considered as an extension practice  standard, in the same manner as extensions to the  PMBOK   Guide Fourth Edition are considered.    Each practice standard will bene t from the inclusion of examples and templates. It is best when an    example or template includes a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses. A background description  may be necessary to put this discussion in the appropriate context. The examples should be aligned with  the relevant information in the standard or its appendix and placed in proximity to that information.   All practice standards shall be written in the same general style and format.     E ach practice standard project will be aligned with or reference other practice standards, as needed.     Each practice standard will be consistent with the     PMBOK   Guide Fourth Edition.   Each practice standard is intended to be more prescriptive than the     PMBOK   Guide Fourth Edition.   59 2009 Project Management Institute.

" In early 2005, PMI began exploration for developing the  rst Practice Standard for Project Risk Management.  Focus would be placed on single project risk management for a single project rather than including programs  or portfolios of projects, with close coupling to the Project Risk Management section of  A Guide to the Project  Management Body of Knowledge     Third Edition. By April 20, 2006, the PMI Standards  Members Advisory Group  approved the following  nal charter for the standard, with Cynthia A. Berg,  PMP, as the Project Manager, and Dr. David Hulett as the Deputy Project Manager. The charter included the  following characteristics for the standard:    Provides information on Project Risk Management that includes information that is clear, complete,    relevant, and generally recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time.    Is consistent with the     PMBOK   Guide   Third Edition, expanding but not contradicting, the concepts  and techniques related to Project Risk Management, and keeps within the limits and practices of  Project Risk Management as described within Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   Guide Third Edition.    Has been reviewed and updated by the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management    Project Team.    Is written for project management practitioners and other stakeholders of the project management    profession.   Describes the processes that are unique to Project Risk Management.      Includes in an appendix, examples and templates of speci c Project Risk Management processes,    tools, andor techniques addressed in the practice standard, with discussions of their strengths and  weaknesses, including background descriptions that put the relative strengths and weaknesses into  context.   Uses the     PMBOK   Guide   Third Edition Glossary as the starting point of its glossary, and does not  contain contradictions.   Uses a glossary term in the text without de nition or additional explanation.     Is aligned with and does not contradict other PMI standards.      Follows the PMI Style Guide, is written in North American English, translatable to PMI of cial    languages, and is sensitive to cultural issues.  60 B APPENDIX B 2009 Project Management Institute.

" In recognition that risk management is not practiced well on many projects, the project team set out to  identify practices that are viewed as best practices, as those are understood, and applied in most successfully  managed projects most of the time.   The project core team was initially formed in the fall of 2005 and consisted of; Dr. David Hillson PMP, Kik  Piney, and Kris Persun.

" Brainstorming is commonly used in a facilitated risk identi cation workshop to identify risks. The standard  rules of brainstorming are often modi ed when the technique is applied to risk identi cation. For example it  is common to structure the risk identi cation brainstorm using risk categories or a risk breakdown structure.  Some evaluation of proposed risks is often included in a risk identi cation brainstorm to remove nonrisks. It is  important to ensure active participation of relevant stakeholders in a risk identi cation brainstorm, and for the  facilitator to manage group dynamics carefully.

" SWOT Analysis identi es four characteristics of a given situation: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and  threats. The technique is commonly used in strategic decision making. It can be adapted for risk identi cation  by changing the interpretation of the four perspectives, such that strengths and weaknesses relate to the  characteristics of the organization conducting the project, and opportunities and threats identify the project  risks. The technique is particularly useful for identifying internallygenerated risks arising from within the  organization. For example opportunities might be found by leveraging organizational strengths, or threats  might arise as a result of organizational weaknesses, as illustrated below.  85 D APPENDIX D 2009 Project Management Institute.

" The probability of a risk occurring can be speci ed in several different ways. One common way is to assign  levels of risk probability by ranges of probability. One bene t of this approach is that the subject matter experts  only need to assess a risks probability within a range rather than as a speci c value. An example, assuming  that a 55 Probability and Impact Matrix is desired, is shown in Figure D11 where the probability ranges are  more tightly de ned at low levels of probability.   Examples of impact level de nitions are very projectspeci c. The values used to specify the level of impact  from very low to very high  should be:    Higher impact, for threats or opportunities, as they move from very low to very high for a speci c    objective    Levels are de ned by the organization as causing the same amount of pain or gain to the project for    each level across objectives    If a risks possible impact is uncertain and could be assigned to more than one level of impact  the analyst may choose to assign the risk to the impact level that represents  the expected or average impact. Alternatively, the risk may be  agged for extra analysis in order to  reduce the range of uncertainty to  t within a single range.   An example of impact level de nitions is shown in Figure D11. These de nitions should be tailored or scaled  by stakeholders to the speci c project. The de nitions, appropriately tailored to the project, can be used for  opportunities and threats.  Table D3. Techniques for Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis  89 D APPENDIX D 2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management     Figure D11. Example of Definitions for Levels of Probability and Impact on Four Specific Objectives  Used to Evaluate Individual Risks.   NoteOpportunities are to be treated as representing a positive saving in time or cost, or increased  functionality. For threats, each impact scale is interpreted negatively, i.e. time delays, increased cost, or  reduced functionality. ",the probability ranges are more tightly de ned at low levels of probability. an example of impact level de nitions is shown in Figure D11. these de nitions should be tailored or scaled by stakeholders.
"Probability and Impact Matrix   Organizations typically assess a risks priority on an objective from the combination of probability of  occurrence and impact on that project objective, using de nitions such as those shown in Figure D11. Risks  are then placed on a probability and impact  matrix, such as one shown below. This matrix includes both  threats and opportunities.   Figure D12.

 AHP is a method to calibrate preferences for achieving the different objectives of a project. Do they prefer  to achieve time more than cost? Is quality more important than scope? What is the relative weighting of the  projects objectives in terms of their priority to the stakeholders or to management? The results are weights   that re ect the relative priority of each objective. This prioritization can be important in  determining how tradeoffs affecting different objectives   will be decided. It can also be used to create an overall project risk priority list from risks that have been  assessed on their implications for individual objectives.

Analysis    Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis seeks to determine the overall risk to project objectives when all risks  potentially operate simultaneously on the project. It provides answers to several questions:    How likely is the project to complete on the schedule date or earlier? How likely is the project actual cost    to be the budgeted cost or less? How reliable will the product be that the project produces? What is the  best decision to make in the face of uncertain results?    How much contingency in time and cost is needed to provide the organization with its desired degree of    con dence in the results? How should the design of the product or system be changed most economically  to increase its reliability?   What are the individual risks that seem to be the most important in determining the overall project risk?   ,analysis perform Quantitative Risk Analysis seeks to determine the overall risk to project objectives when all risks potentially operate simultaneously on the project. how likely is the project actual cost to be the budgeted cost or less? how much contingency in time and cost is needed to provide the organization with its desired degree of con dence in the results?

" An analytical technique to determine the essential features and relationships of components in the  project management plan to establish a reserve for the schedule duration, budget, estimated cost, or  funds for a project. Tracking the state of the reserve through project execution will provide summary  information as to the evolution of the status of the corresponding risks. This information can be useful  when reporting up the organization to those responsible for several projects. In addition, once a  corresponding risk occurs or ceases to be current , the  corresponding reserve needs to be reviewed in order to assess whether it still provides the agreed level  of confidence.   Time buffers can be used in two different ways:   To provide for accepted schedule risks, as described above or     As a schedulingrelated technique in critical chain project management .     In contrast with the contingency reserve for identified risks, the buffers in CCPM provide a shared  mechanism for accommodating the natural variability of activity durations over a sequence  of  activities. Tracking the rate at which each such buffer is used during project execution provides valuable  information at a given point in time as to the level of schedule risk along that chain, and is used in  CCPM for adapting the priority or management focus for additional analysis and as necessary triggering  further risk management activities.
