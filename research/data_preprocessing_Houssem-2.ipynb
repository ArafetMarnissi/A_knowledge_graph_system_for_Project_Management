            "2.   Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk\n",
            "Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to\n",
            "apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is\n",

            "Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates\n",

            "Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary,\n",
            "Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and\n",

            "the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk\n",
            "into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and\n",

            "The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use\n",
            "in the   PMBOK    ®    Guide   – Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process\n",
            "descriptions. The deﬁ nition of project risk given in the   PMBOK    ®    Guide  – Fourth Edition is as follows:\n",
            "Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative\n",
            "effect on a project’s objectives.\n",
            "This deﬁ nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When\n",
            "assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty\n",
            "dimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other\n",
            "descriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”).\n",
            "The deﬁ nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and\n",
            "more general conditions which are less speciﬁ c but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The deﬁ nition of project\n",
            "risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project’s objectives, as\n",
            "well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and\n",
            "opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uniﬁ ed Project Risk Management\n",
            "process. This allows for the gain of synergies and efﬁ ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses\n",
            "and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.\n",
            "Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they\n",
            "did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are\n",
            "events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise\n",
            "to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project\n",
            "objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement\n",
            "or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3).\n",
            "When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or\n",

            "elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project\n",

            "2.   Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk\n",
            "Management. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to\n",
            "apply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is\n",
            "tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There\n",

            "The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can\n",
            "establish processes speciﬁ c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with\n",

            "2.2 Deﬁ nition of Project Risk\n",
            "The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use\n",
            "in the   PMBOK    ®    Guide   – Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process\n",
            "descriptions. The deﬁ nition of project risk given in the   PMBOK    ®    Guide  – Fourth Edition is as follows:\n",
            "Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative\n",
            "effect on a project’s objectives.\n",
            "This deﬁ nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When\n",
            "assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty\n",
            "dimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other\n",
            "descriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”).\n",
            "The deﬁ nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and\n",
            "more general conditions which are less speciﬁ c but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The deﬁ nition of project\n",
            "risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project’s objectives, as\n",
            "well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and\n",
            "opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uniﬁ ed Project Risk Management\n",

            "and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.\n",
            "Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they\n",
            "did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are\n",
            "events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise\n",
            "to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project\n",

            "or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3).\n",
            "When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or\n",

            "Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is\n",
            "more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual\n",
            "elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project\n",
            "outcome. It is an important component of strategic decision-making, program and portfolio management,\n",
            "and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher\n",

            "The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall\n",
            "project risk matters. A wide range of factors inﬂ uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project\n",
            "within the range of stakeholders’ overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the\n",
            "performance of the project, and the stakeholders’ sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts,\n",
            "industrial relations, and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased\n",
            "certainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk\n",
            "is regarded is usually also strongly inﬂ uenced by an organization’s culture. Different organizations are more\n",

            "for this practice standard: “Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting\n",

            "This chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply Project Risk Management to projects\n",
            "following the approach described in Chapter 11 of the   PMBOK    ®     Guide   – Fourth Edition. These principles and\n",
            "concepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although\n",
            "the terminology may differ in some details.\n",
            "The execution of the Project Risk Management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice\n",
            "standard and so is not discussed here.\n",
            "2.2 Deﬁ nition of Project Risk\n",
            "The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use\n",
            "in the   PMBOK    ®    Guide   – Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process\n",
            "descriptions. The deﬁ nition of project risk given in the   PMBOK    ®    Guide  – Fourth Edition is as follows:\n",
            "Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative\n",
            "effect on a project’s objectives.\n",
            "This deﬁ nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When\n",
            "assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty\n",
            "dimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other\n",
            "descriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”).\n",
            "The deﬁ nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and\n",
            "more general conditions which are less speciﬁ c but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The deﬁ nition of project\n",
            "risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project’s objectives, as\n",
            "well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and\n",
            "opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uniﬁ ed Project Risk Management\n",
            "process. This allows for the gain of synergies and efﬁ ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses\n",
            "and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.\n",
            "Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they\n",
            "did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are\n",
            "events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise\n",
            "to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project\n",
            "objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement\n",
            "or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3).\n",
            "When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or\n",
            "problems; opportunities which occur may be called beneﬁ ts. Both issues/problems and beneﬁ ts entail project\n",
            "management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process.\n",
            "2.3 Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk\n",
            "It is useful to consider project risk at two levels: individual risks and overall project risk.\n",
            "Individual risks are speciﬁ c events or conditions that might affect project objectives. An individual risk\n",
            "may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding\n",
            "individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project\n",
            "success. Day-to-day Project Risk Management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the\n",
            "prospects of a successful project outcome.\n",
            "Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is\n",
            "more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual\n",
            "elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project\n",
            "outcome. It is an important component of strategic decision-making, program and portfolio management,\n",
            "and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher\n",
            "levels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency\n",
            "reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether\n",
            "the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances.\n",
            "2.4 Stakeholder Risk Attitudes\n",
            "The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall\n",
            "project risk matters. A wide range of factors inﬂ uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project\n",
            "within the range of stakeholders’ overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the\n",
            "performance of the project, and the stakeholders’ sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts,\n",
            "industrial relations, and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased\n",
            "certainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk\n",
            "is regarded is usually also strongly inﬂ uenced by an organization’s culture. Different organizations are more\n",
            "or less open, and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied.\n",
            "Understanding stakeholders’ attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning\n",
            "that precedes risk identiﬁ cation and analysis, in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder\n",
            "satisfaction with the project’s results. These attitudes should be identiﬁ ed and managed proactively and\n",
            "deliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another\n",
            "for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single\n",
            "stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project.\n",
            "It is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where\n",
            "the team is international, cross-industry, or multi-organizational.\n",
            "2.5 Iterative Process\n",
            "It is the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. The amount\n",
            "of information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will\n",
            "not, new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identiﬁ ed may change. As a\n",
            "result, the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively\n",
